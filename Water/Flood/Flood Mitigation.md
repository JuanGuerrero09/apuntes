Guide book: Flood Modeling, Prediction and Mitigation

# Introduction
## Flood and Hazard Definitions
Floods are the common name for *extreme runoff volumes after an intensive storm rainfall event over a drainage basin*. These are the most destructive of natural disasters and cause the greatest number of deaths.

In small basins, *flash floods* occur more frequently, because during an intensive storm rainfall the basin receives more than it could transfer as surface water in a short time of period.

The main causes of flood are the amount and distribution of precipitation in the drainage area. Assessment of a flood requires knowledge from *meteorology*, *geomorphology*, *ecology* and *surface water hydrology and hydraulics principles.*

For the hydro-meteorologicals events, the *hydrological cycle* is a combination of all possible waterways among the atmosphere, lithosphere, biosphere, hydrosphere and cryosphere in addition to specific ways within each one of these spheres.

Rainfall phenomena are the major hydrological events, which subsequently cause other hydrological events such as the depression, interception, evaporation, infiltration, runoff, and flood.

*Hydrology* is the science of water occurrence, movement, and transport. Hydrology provisdes basic laws, equations, algorithms, procedures and modeling of earth-systems events for the practical use of humanity.
