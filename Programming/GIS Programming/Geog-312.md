Geospatial data analysis is essential for various applications, including environmental monitoring, urban planning, and mapping. Python’s ecosystem offers a robust set of libraries for handling both vector and raster data, performing spatial analysis, and creating interactive maps. Some of the core libraries we will work with include:

- **[GeoPandas](https://geopandas.org/):** For handling vector data such as shapefiles, GeoJSON, and performing spatial operations.
    
- **[Rasterio](https://rasterio.readthedocs.io/):** To read, analyze, and write raster data (e.g., satellite imagery).
    
- **[Xarray](https://xarray.pydata.org/):** For multidimensional array-based data, often used with climate and meteorological datasets.
    
- **[Leafmap](https://leafmap.org/):** Simplifies creating interactive maps with minimal code.
    
- **[MapLibre](https://eodagmbh.github.io/py-maplibregl/):** A tool for building interactive, customizable map visualizations using vector tiles.
    
- **[WhiteboxTools](https://github.com/jblindsay/whitebox-tools):** A suite of GIS tools for spatial analysis.
    
- **[Geemap](https://geemap.org/):** Combines the power of Google Earth Engine with Python for large-scale geospatial analysis.
    
- **[Segment-geospatial](https://samgeo.gishub.org/):** An advanced tool for image segmentation in geospatial analysis.
    
- **[HyperCoast](https://hypercoast.org/):** Used for coastal data modeling and analysis.
    
- **[DuckDB](https://duckdb.org/):** A fast, embeddable analytical database with powerful spatial query capabilities.
    
- **[GDAL](https://gdal.org/):** One of the most widely used libraries for raster and vector data processing.
