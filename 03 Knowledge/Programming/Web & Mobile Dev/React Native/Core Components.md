### View
The most fundamental component for building a UI, `View` is a container that supports layout with [flexbox](https://reactnative.dev/docs/flexbox), [style](https://reactnative.dev/docs/style), [some touch handling](https://reactnative.dev/docs/handling-touches), and [accessibility](https://reactnative.dev/docs/accessibility) controls. `View` maps directly to the native view equivalent on whatever platform React Native is running on, whether that is a `UIView`, `<div>`, `android.view`, etc.

`View` is designed to be nested inside other views and can have 0 to many children of any type.
