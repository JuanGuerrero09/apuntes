## Sediment Transport


ds $\tau_0 = \rho_w g \frac{A}{p} sin\alpha = \rho_w g r_{hy} S_E$ 
### Sediment Classes

Sediments are predominantly mechanically decomposed rock material

- Very coarse soil 
- Coarse soil (granular)
- Fine soil (cohesiv)
### Critical Shear Stress

- Sedimentological  Froude Number
- Sedimentological  Reynolds Number

### Bed Load Motion

Bed load motion occurs for $\tau_* > (\tau_*)_c$ 
The stability parameter \tau_* or Shields parameter?? is dimentionless

$$
\tau_* = \frac{V_*^2}{(s-1)gd_S}= \frac{\tau_o}{\rho s-1)gd_S}
$$
Beign s the relative density of sediment particle s = \rho_s / \rho

### Sediment Transport Curve

Meyer-Peter Müller

$$
m_G = \frac{8}{\sqrt{\rho_w}} \cdot \frac{\rho_s}{(\rho_s-\rho_w)\cdot g}\cdot (\rho_w\cdot g \cdot r_{hy}\cdot I - 0.047 \cdot (\rho_s-\rho_w) \cdot g \cdot d_{65})^{3/2}
$$
If the value is possitive the sediment will move, if negative the root is not possible so is nor moving

How many sediment is transported a 200 m3 dischage - 2 kg/s 


### Characteristic Sediment Diameter

$$d_{ch} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(\Delta p_i \cdot d_{k,i})}{100\%}$$

### Bed Shear Stress <-> Bed Form

Flat - Ripples - Riplles on dunes - Dunes - Flat dunes - Flat bottom - Antidunes

*ripples generally only at $d_{50}$*

### Influence of Geometric Chnages on Sediment Transport

Scour?

### Scouring at Piers/Bridges
Types of scour:
- Local scour?  Erosion occurring directly around bridge piers or
abutments due to flow acceleration and vortex formation. The localized
scour is the most common scour happening to bridges.
	- Clearwaters scour  No sediment is deposited in the scouring area
from the upstream side of the river
	- Live-Bed Scour Sediments are continuously supplied from the
upstream to the scour zone.
- Contraction scour Erosion resulting from the narrowing of a river or
stream, which increases flow velocity and sediment transport capacity
- General scour Overall degradation of the riverbed across a bridge
site, often due to natural changes in the river's flow regime. 

#### Calculation approach

$$d_S = K_{yW} K_I K_d K_s K_\theta K_G$$
ds -> dept of scoure

… parameter for consideration of water depth
… parameter for intensity of the flow (vcrit)
… parameter for consideration of sediment particle
… parameter for consideration of the pier shape
… parameter for consideration of the flow angle
… parameter for geometrical effects of the pier
