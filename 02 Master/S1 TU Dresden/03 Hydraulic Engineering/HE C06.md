# 📒Class Summary

This lecture introduced core concepts in **River Engineering**, focusing on human interventions and their impact on natural fluvial systems. The session covered how various **river regulation measures** disrupt the **bed load balance** (sediment transport equilibrium). Detailed attention was given to **channel regulation structures** like **groynes** and their functional classifications.

## River Engineering

### River Engineering - Measures

#### Disturbance in Bed Load Balance

The **bed load balance** refers to the equilibrium state where the amount of sediment material (sand, gravel, cobbles) transported into a river section is equal to the amount of sediment transported out of that section. Human interventions typically disturb this balance, leading to either **erosion (degradation)** or **sedimentation (aggradation)**.

Common disturbances and their effects:

- **Sediment Retention in Reservoirs/Dams:** Dams act as barriers, causing sediments to accumulate (aggrade) in the **upper part** of the reservoir. Downstream of the dam, the water is "sediment-starved" and compensates by eroding the riverbed, leading to degradation.

- **Regulation of the River:** Straightening the channel or increasing the slope can increase the **flow velocity** and **shear stress** on the bed. This results in an increased capacity for sediment transport, often leading to erosion (degradation).

- **Water Withdrawal for Cooling of Powerhouses:** Industrial uses (e.g., nuclear plants) can return heated water to the river. While the temperature increase is usually minor (a few degrees), the change can slightly alter the density and viscosity of the water, which in turn influences the sediment settling velocity. Additionally, the withdrawal/return flow structures can locally modify the channel geometry, promoting local erosion or sedimentation.

- **Narrowing the Cross Sections (Groynes/Groins):** Structures placed perpendicular to the flow reduce the width of the main channel. This increases the **flow velocity** in the narrowed section, enhancing the river's erosive power and leading to **degradation** of the central, main channel.

- **Sediment Disposal:** The practice of dumping excavated sediment directly into the river channel. If disposal exceeds the transport capacity, it leads to localized **aggradation** (build-up) of the riverbed.

#### Channel Regulation Structures and Measures

River engineering measures are classified based on the water level they are designed to regulate:

- **LW (Low Water Level) – Regulation:** Designed to ensure sufficient navigation depth and stable channels during dry periods. Includes structures like **groynes**, **training dams** (longitudinal dikes), **revetments** (bank protection), **river bottom stabilization** (sills/weirs), and **dams**.
    
- **MW (Medium Water Level) – Regulation:** Measures that shape the overall channel geometry. Includes **groynes**, **revetments** (to prevent bank erosion), and **training dams**.
    
- **HL (High Water Level) – Regulation:** Designed to prevent catastrophic flooding. Primarily includes **levees** (dikes) and **polders** (areas protected by dikes, often used as flood storage).

#### Groynes

**Groynes** (or river training walls) are hydraulic structures built out from the riverbank, typically perpendicular or at an angle to the main flow direction. Groynes serve to **constrict the flow** of the river into a narrower, deeper main channel. By reducing the width, they increase the flow velocity in the constricted section, which enhances the river's capacity to transport sediment. The final result is a new equilibrium where the main channel is deeper for navigation.

- **Upstream Facing (Repelling Groynes):** The groyne points slightly upstream. This is the **most common** type. They effectively repel the main current toward the center of the river.
- **Orthogonal Groynes:** Built perpendicular to the bank. Often used in tidal regions where flow direction reverses. Considered **deflecting groynes**.
- **Downstream Facing Angled Groynes (Attracting Groynes):** Rarely used. They gently guide the flow toward the bank.

### Fish Migration

#### Interruption of river continuity

Human interventions have fragmented natural river habitats, disrupting the life cycles of migrating fish species.

- **Dams, Weirs:** These are **physical barriers** that completely block the migratory pathway, preventing fish from accessing spawning grounds upstream or feeding grounds downstream.

- **Pollution:** Chemical or nutrient pollution can create **toxic zones** or **anoxic conditions** (low oxygen) that fish cannot pass through or survive in, acting as a chemical barrier.
 
- **High Temperature (Thermal Pollution):** Heated water discharge (e.g., from power plants) can create thermal barriers. Fish are often sensitive to temperature changes, which can disrupt their metabolic rates, breeding cues, or even be lethal.

- **Absence of Light:** While less common than physical barriers, certain types of migration cues rely on ambient light levels. Extended dark pipes or tunnels can disorient or deter migration for some species.

- **Absence of Natural Sediments:** Altered sediment balance (e.g., sediment-starved rivers downstream of dams) changes the riverbed composition. This is critical for species that rely on specific substrate types (gravel, sand) for **spawning** or **hiding**.

#### Motivation Behind Fish Migration

Fish migrate for different biological necessities, often depending on the species, age, and season:

- **Migration between different habitats:** Seeking areas with optimal resources.

- **Spawning migration:** The primary driver, moving long distances to reach specific breeding grounds.
 
- **Overwinter survival migration:** Moving to deeper, warmer, or more stable water bodies to survive the cold season.

- **Foraging migration:** Traveling to rich feeding grounds.

- **Drifting:** Passive movement of eggs or larvae with the current.

- **Compensation:** Adjusting position in the stream to counter the effects of passive drifting.

#### Fishways

**Fishways** (or fish ladders) are hydraulic structures designed to restore river continuity by allowing fish to bypass barriers (weirs, dams) safely.

- **Natural Solutions (Nature-like Fishways):** Creating a **bypass channel** or **path around the dam** that mimics the conditions of a natural river, using gravel, boulders, and low-slope sections to provide resting pools and appropriate flow velocities.

- **Technical Solutions (Fish Ladders/Pool-and-Weir Fishways):** Involve a series of small **stairs** or stepped pools separated by small weirs or baffles. Fish jump or swim up the pools, using the lower velocity areas for rest between high-energy steps.

#### Types of Fish Migration

Fish migration patterns are categorized based on the environments utilized:

- **Potamodromous:** Fish species that migrate **only within fresh water** (e.g., trout moving between small streams and larger rivers).

- **Diadromous:** Fish species that migrate **between fresh water and salt water**. This is the overarching category.
    
    - **Anadromous:** Species that spend most of their lives in **salt water** and migrate to **fresh water** to spawn (e.g., salmon, striped bass).
    
    - **Catadromous:** Species that spend most of their lives in **fresh water** and migrate to **salt water** to spawn (e.g., freshwater eels).

# 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Bed Load Balance** is the equilibrium between incoming and outgoing sediment in a river reach; human interventions (dams, regulation) typically disrupt this balance, causing downstream degradation (erosion).
- **Groynes** are perpendicular structures used for Low Water (LW) regulation; they narrow the main channel to increase velocity, promoting deep channel degradation for navigation and sedimentation in groyne fields.
- River regulation measures are classified by their design water level: LW (navigation), MW (channel shape), and HL (flood protection).
- **River Continuity** is interrupted by physical barriers (dams), chemical barriers (pollution), and thermal barriers (high temperature).
- **Fishways** (natural bypasses or technical ladders) are essential engineering solutions to mitigate the impact of barriers on fish migration.
- Migration types are classified by habitat: **Potamodromous** (freshwater only), **Anadromous** (sea to fresh for spawning), and **Catadromous** (fresh to sea for spawning).
