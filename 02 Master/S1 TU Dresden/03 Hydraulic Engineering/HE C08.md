## Waterways Engineering

### Hydropower Plants

Fish Locomotion

Swim velocity
	Sprinting speed
	Critical speed
	Increased speed
	Longterm speed

How much distance can the fish cover

Maximum succeed length? L_{fish}

Limiting Value Flow Velocity
> water velocity, not the fish

Fish pasage so fish can move to the next section

That total height difference the limiting VFV depends on the region

Limiting Value Specific Power Density

- high turbulence complicate orientation and increase energy consume for fish
- depending on the region the power density of basin and channel are deffined

Safety dimensionning values


#### Hydropower Plants - General Information

China leads the world production

#### Quantification of Hydropower and Work Capacity

Gravitational potential available of the water
$$
P_{ef}(t) = \eta_{tot}(t)\cdot\rho\cdot g\cdot Q(t) \cdot h_{f, tot}(t)
$$
Efficiency rations
$$
\eta_{tot} = \eta_{turbine}
$$

#### Typical Layout

- Dam/Weir
- Spillway
- Intake Structure
- Sand trap
- Headrace
- Surge Tank/Fore bay?
- Penstock
- Powerhouse
- Tail Race
- Switchyard
- Transmission lines

Turbines

Extract energy from flowing water and convert it to mechanical energy to drive electric generators.

Main types: Impulse turbines (submerged?) and reaction turbine

Fixed nozzle?

- Pelton turbine

##### Design of a Pelton turbine:

Nozzles depending on the Flow
