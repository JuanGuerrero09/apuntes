## River Engineering

### Fish Migration

#### Predominant Fish Zones

Rhitral
- Trout region (upper and lower), Temp: 5-10, very high oxygen level, stones sediment
- Greyling region, Temp: 8-14, high oxygen level, coarse gravel sediment
Potamal
- Barbel region: Temp: 12-18, high oxygen at surface, decreasing towards bed, fine gravel sediment
- Bream region: Temp: 16-20, enough oxygen at surface insufficient near bed, sand sediment
- Ruff and flounder region: Temp above 20 degrees, enough oxygen at surface, not at bed, silt sediment

#### Fish Locomotion

Swim velocity $[L_{fish}/s]$ vs time $\rightarrow$ sprinting speed / critical speed / increased speed / longterm speed 

Maximum succeed length?
