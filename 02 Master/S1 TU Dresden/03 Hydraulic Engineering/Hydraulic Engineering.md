# 📚Notes


In coastal and ocean engineering, water depth is classified as **deep water** or **shallow water** based on the ratio of the **water depth (h)** to the **wavelength (L)** of surface waves. When the depth is greater than half the wavelength (h/L > 1/2), the water is considered **deep**, meaning the waves do not feel the seabed and their motion is confined near the surface. When the depth is much smaller than the wavelength (h/L < 1/20), the water is classified as **shallow**, where waves are strongly influenced by the seabed. The region between these two limits (1/20 < h/L < 1/2) is known as **intermediate water**, where wave characteristics gradually transition between deep and shallow conditions.

# Introduction to River Engineering

## 🌊 Introduction to River Engineering

**River Engineering** deals with the design, construction, and management of structures and measures to improve, restore, or maintain river systems for human and environmental needs.

It aims at balancing **engineering objectives** (navigation, flood protection, water supply, energy) with **ecological sustainability** (habitat conservation, sediment continuity, and groundwater exchange).

### Main Purposes

- **Flood control:** Prevent damage and loss of life.
- **Water supply and irrigation:** Manage storage and diversion.
- **Hydropower generation:** Utilize flow and elevation difference.
- **Navigation and transport:** Maintain suitable depths and flow conditions.
- **Environmental restoration:** Reconnect floodplains, protect ecosystems.

---
## 🔁 The Hydrologic Cycle and River System

The **hydrologic cycle** describes the continuous circulation of water between the Earth and the atmosphere, driven by solar energy.  
Main processes: **Evaporation**, **Transpiration**, **Condensation**, **Precipitation**, and **Runoff**.

### Key Components of a River System

- **Channel:** The physical path through which water flows.
- **Catchment Area (Drainage Basin):** Land area that collects precipitation and directs it to a single outlet.
- **Rainfall–Runoff Relationship:** Describes how rainfall converts into streamflow; influenced by soil type, vegetation, slope, and land use.
- **Sediment Yield:** Total amount of sediment transported from the catchment to the outlet (lake, ocean).

---
## 🧭 River Classification

### 1. Based on Discharge Variation

|River Type|Discharge Behaviour|Example|Region|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Perennial (Permanent)**|Flows all year round|Amazon, Nile, Mississippi|Humid regions|
|**Intermittent (Seasonal)**|Flows only during wet seasons|Murray, Senegal|Monsoonal or Mediterranean|
|**Ephemeral (Temporary)**|Flows only after rainfall|Wadis, Arizona rivers|Arid/semi-arid|
|**Exotic**|Crosses dry areas but originates in humid zones|Nile, Colorado|Arid regions|
|**Torrential**|Sudden, violent surges|Himalayan streams|Mountainous regions|

---

### 2. Based on Location

|**River Type**|**Gradient**|**Flow Speed**|**Channel Shape**|**Sediment**|**Ecosystem**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Mountain Rivers**|High|Fast|V-shaped|High erosion|Cold, clear waters, diverse fauna|
|**Floodplain Rivers**|Low|Slow|Wide, meandering|Fertile alluvium|Wetlands, high biodiversity|
|**Delta Rivers**|Very Low|Slow/Variable|Triangular or Fan-shaped|Depositional|Nutrient-rich ecosystems|
|**Tidal Rivers**|Variable|Variable|Wide, tide-influenced|Brackish sediment|Estuaries, mangroves, salt marshes|

---

### 3. Based on Planform (Channel Shape)

|**Feature**|**Straight Rivers**|**Meandering Rivers**|**Braided Rivers**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Formation**|Found in steep terrains; flow follows geological constraints.|Formed in flatter terrain where erosion and deposition alternate.|Occur where sediment load is high and discharge fluctuates.|
|**Channel Shape**|Straight|Curved (meanders)|Interconnected channels|
|**Terrain**|Steep, mountainous|Flat plains|Glacial or sediment-rich areas|
|**Gradient**|High|Low|Moderate|
|**Sediment Transport**|High|Moderate|High|
|**Erosion/Deposition**|Erosion|Outer-bank erosion, inner-bank deposition|Constant shifting and reworking of bars|

---

## 🏞️ Longitudinal Profile and Channel Patterns

A river’s profile evolves from **steep headwaters (erosional)** to **flat floodplains (depositional)**:

|Section|Dominant Process|Typical Features|
|---|---|---|
|**Headwaters**|Erosion|V-shaped valleys, waterfalls|
|**Middle Course**|Equilibrium|Meanders, floodplains|
|**Lower Course**|Sedimentation|Deltas, estuaries|

![[Pasted image 20251101140854.png]]
**Channel Patterns**
- Straight
- Braided
- Meandering
![[Pasted image 20251101140903.png]]

## 🌀 Flow Dynamics

### Flow in a Straight Channel

- Maximum velocity at mid-depth in the center.
- Secondary rotary currents form due to sidewall friction and transverse gradients.

### Flow in Bends

- **Concave bank (outer side):** Higher velocity → erosion.
- **Convex bank (inner side):** Lower velocity → sediment deposition.
- Continuous alternation leads to **meanders (S-shaped curves)**.

![[Pasted image 20251101141010.png]]
**Channel Shifting:**  
Over time, banks erode and the entire channel migrates laterally due to **shear stress**.

---
## 🌪️ Currents in Watercourses

- **Primary current:** Main downstream flow driven by gravity and slope.
- **Secondary current:** Cross-sectional flow generated by centrifugal force.
- **Spiral current:** Helical motion transporting sediment from inner to outer banks.

---
## 🌊 Stream Channel Migration

### Cutbank (Concave Bank)

- High velocity
- High shear stress
- **Erosion zone**

### Point Bar (Convex Bank)

- Low velocity
- Low shear stress
- **Deposition zone**

This alternation of erosion and deposition causes **channel sinuosity** — the ratio of channel length to valley length.

**Neck Formation → Cutoff → Oxbow Lake Sequence:**

1. Bends grow due to continuous outer-bank erosion.
2. The “neck” narrows between adjacent meanders.
3. During flood events, the river cuts through the neck.
4. The abandoned meander becomes an **oxbow lake**.

![[Pasted image 20251101141217.png]]

---
## 🧩 Channel Pattern Characteristics

**Meandering vs. Braided Rivers:**
![[Pasted image 20251016101658.png]]

If a **meandering river** is artificially straightened:

- Velocity increases
- Erosion intensifies downstream
- Habitat diversity decreases
- Flood peaks may rise

---
## 🌿 Vegetation Zones and Groundwater Interaction

**Vegetation Distribution:**

- **High flood level:** hardwood species
- **Flood zone:** willow bushes, softwood
- **Mean water level:** reeds
- **Low water level:** pondweeds, aquatic plants

![[Pasted image 20251016102321.png]]

**Groundwater Connection:**

- Rivers and aquifers are hydraulically linked.
- During high flows, surface water **recharges groundwater**.
- During dry periods, groundwater **feeds the river**.

![[Pasted image 20251016102452.png]]

---
## 🌊 Open Channel Hydraulics

### General Energy Gradient Equation

$$
\nabla  E_n = \frac{
C}{2}\frac{
W}{g}\frac{
U^2}{r_c}
$$
Where:

- **C** = 1.5 for _subcritical flow_ and 2 for _supercritical flow_.
- **W** = channel width.
- **U** = mean velocity.
- **$r_c$** = radius of curvature.

This equation expresses the energy slope or energy gradient due to curvature and velocity distribution.

---

## ⚙️ Theoretical Principles

**Discharge (Q)** and **water level (h)** are key for:
- Flood protection and forecasting.
- Calibration of hydraulic models.
- Dam control and regulation.
- Sediment transport estimation.
- Navigation and ecological management.
A **1D approach** assumes velocity is constant along the cross-section — suitable for simple geometries.  
If velocity varies in space or time, a **2D or 3D numerical model** is required.

## 💧 Discharge Calculation in Open Channels (1D)

### Brahms / de Chézy Formula
$$v_m = C \sqrt{r_{hy}S_E}$$

Where:
- **C** = Chézy coefficient (depends on roughness and geometry).
- **$r_{hy}$** = hydraulic radius = $\frac{A}{P}$ (A = area, P = wetted perimeter).
- **$S_E$** = energy slope or energy grade line.

> Purely empirical and rarely used today — replaced by **Manning** and **Darcy-Weisbach** formulations.

![[Pasted image 20251023094330.png]]

---

### Steady and Uniform Flow
For **steady, uniform flow**:
$$S_E = S_{WS} = S_{Bed} = S$$
>Energy slope is equal to water surface slope and bed slope.

That is, the slopes of the **energy line**, **water surface**, and **channel bed** are equal.

- **Steady flow:** inflow = outflow (no storage or retention).
- **Uniform flow:** depth and velocity remain constant along the channel.
#### Steady Flow Conditions:
$$Q_{in} = Q_{out}$$
$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = 0\quad \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} = 0 \quad \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = 0 
$$
> “Time” is the defining criterion — parameters do not vary with time.
#### Uniform Flow
$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = 0\quad \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = 0 \quad \frac{\partial A}{\partial x} = 0 
$$

>“Space” is the defining criterion — parameters do not vary along the flow direction.

## 🌫️ Flow Regimes: Laminar vs Turbulent

![[Pasted image 20251023095758.png]]

Flow regime depends on the **Reynolds number (Re)** — the ratio of inertial to viscous forces.

For open channels:

$$
\begin{align}
Re = \frac{v\; 4 \; r_{hy}}{v} 
\end{align}
$$
Where:

- **v** = mean velocity
- **$r_{hy}$** = hydraulic radius (m)
- **ν** = kinematic viscosity (m²/s)

| Flow Type        | Condition       | Characteristics         |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Laminar**      | Re < 500        | Smooth, orderly layers  |
| **Transitional** | 500 < Re < 2000 | Mixed behaviour         |
| **Turbulent**    | Re > 2000       | Chaotic, eddy-dominated |

At **20°C**, water properties are approximately:

- Dynamic viscosity (μ) = 1.002 × 10⁻³ N·s/m²
- Kinematic viscosity (ν) = 1.004 × 10⁻⁶ m²/s
- Density (ρ) = 998 kg/m³

---

### Hydraulic Diameter and Radius

$$D_h =4\frac{A}{P_W} \quad \text{and} \quad R_h =  \frac{A}{P_W}$$ 

These describe the relationship between cross-sectional area ($A$) and wetted perimeter ($P_W$), critical in calculating resistance and flow type.

---
### Turbulent Flow Types

- **Hydraulically smooth:** roughness elements are small compared to viscous sublayer.
- **Transitional:** partial influence of roughness.
- **Hydraulically rough:** turbulence fully developed; roughness dominates friction.
---
#### 🌊 Froude Number

The **Froude number (Fr)** compares **inertial** and **gravitational** forces:
$$
Fr = \frac{v}{\sqrt{g\;h}}
$$
Where $\sqrt{g h}$ is the **wave celerity** (speed of small surface waves).

|Flow Type|Condition|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Subcritical**|Fr < 1|Slow, deep flow; gravity dominates.|
|**Critical**|Fr = 1|Transition point; energy transfer maximum.|
|**Supercritical**|Fr > 1|Fast, shallow flow; inertia dominates.|
At **Fr = 1**, a **hydraulic jump** occurs — a sudden transition from supercritical to subcritical flow, dissipating energy.  
Wave speed: $c = \sqrt{g y}$

> **Practical test:** If a floating object can move upstream, the flow is subcritical; if it only drifts downstream, it’s supercritical.

## ⚖️ Discharge Calculation Methods

### Gauckler–Manning–Strickler Equation

$$v_m = k_{St} \; r_{hy}^{2/3} \; S_E^{1/2}$$

Where:

- **$k_{st}$** = Strickler roughness coefficient [m¹ᐟ³/s]
- **$r_{hy}$** = hydraulic radius [m]
- **$S_E$** = energy slope

**Relationship:**  
$$n = \frac{1}{k_{St}}$$
where **n** is the **Manning roughness coefficient**.

Roughness depends on material, vegetation, and geometry — it does **not change significantly with water level**.
###### Typical Roughness Coefficients ($k_{St}$)

![[Pasted image 20251101181714.png]]
![[Pasted image 20251101181722.png]]

### Darcy–Weisbach Equation

$$
v_m = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}}\sqrt{8 \cdot g\cdot r_{hy}\cdot S_E}
$$

Where:

- **λ** = friction factor (from **Colebrook equation**)- :

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}} = -2.0 \log_{10}\left(\frac{k_s}{3.7 D_h} + \frac{2.51}{Re \sqrt{\lambda}}\right)$$

- **C (Chézy)** is related to λ as:

$$
C = \frac{\sqrt{8 \; g}}{\sqrt{\lambda}}
$$

> This approach accounts for roughness variation with depth — more accurate for complex natural channels.

##### Sample Calculation - Uniform Roughness

![[Pasted image 20251102175044.png]]

## 🧮 Composite Roughness in Non-Uniform Channels

When a cross-section has multiple materials or sub-sections, use **weighted averages**.

### Manning–Strickler:

$$k_{St,total} = \left[\frac{P_{total}}{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{p_i}{k_{St,i}^{3/2}}\right)}\right]^{3/2}$$
### Darcy–Weisbach:

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda_{total}}} = \sqrt{\frac{P_{total}}{\sum_{i=1}^n (p_i \, \lambda_i)}}$$
Where:

- **pᵢ** = wetted perimeter of subsection _i_
- **$k_{st,i}$** = Strickler coefficient of subsection _i_

#### Properties of typical channel cross sections

## 🌊 Open Channel Hydraulics II

### Discharge Calculation in Open Channels

Flow discharge in open channels depends mainly on the **hydraulic radius** ($r_{hy}$) and the **energy slope** ($S_E$):

$$Q = A \cdot v_m \propto r_{hy}^{2/3} S_E^{1/2}$$

---

### Compound Channels

When a river overflows its main channel and extends onto the **floodplains**, the flow becomes **non-uniform**.  
Using a single roughness coefficient for the entire section leads to large errors since **velocity** in the floodplain and the main channel differ significantly.

The cross section is divided into **main channel**, **left bank**, and **right bank**.  
Hydraulic interaction between sub-sections can generate:

- Momentum transfer
- Interface vortices
- Secondary flow
- Shear layers
- Local velocity variations
$$
Q_{tot} = \sum ^n_{i=1} (V_{m, i} \;.\; A_i)
$$
![[Pasted image 20251030092834.png]]

This composite approach allows calculating discharge for **compound channels** more accurately.
### Channels with Vegetation

Vegetation increases resistance and decreases velocity.  
Dense or tall vegetation (trees, reeds) reduces flow efficiency and modifies turbulence patterns.  
If vegetation cannot be modeled directly, a **modified roughness coefficient ($K_{s,t}$)** is applied.
![[Pasted image 20251030093123.png]]
**Regions:**

- **Region I – Uninfluenced Zone:**  
    The flow is **not influenced by vegetation**. It occurs between $(b_v - b_m)$, close to the outer floodplain limit.
    
- **Region II – Transition Zone:**  
    The **current starts to be influenced** by vegetation. Flow velocity begins to increase toward the main channel.
    
- **Region III – Main Channel Zone:**  
    The flow becomes **fully influenced and stabilized** in the main channel.  
    Contains an **inflection point** where the velocity gradient changes before reaching the maximum $V(y)$ at the channel centerline.

## 🪨Sediment Transport

### Modes of Sediment Transport

Sediment moves in rivers depending on grain size, flow energy, and turbulence.

#### 1️⃣ Wash Load

- Fine material (silt and clay, < 0.0625 mm).
- Does **not** interact with the bed.
- Sourced from banks and watershed.
- Transported entirely in suspension.
#### 2️⃣ Bed Material Load

- Material that **interacts with the bed** and affects channel morphology.
- Divided into:
    - **Bed Load:**
        - Moves in contact with the bed (rolling, sliding, saltating).
        - Coarser material, low turbulence influence.
    - **Suspended Bed Material Load:**
        - Finer particles lifted by turbulence.
        - Occasional contact with bed.

### Morphological Forms

| Morphological form       | Condition                        | Meaning                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Equilibrium state**    | ($G_z = G_T$)                    | Sediment input and transport capacity are balanced — no net erosion or deposition (the bed is stable). |
| **Erosive state**        | ( $G_z < G_T$ )                  | The flow can carry _more_ sediment than is available — it erodes the bed to reach capacity.            |
| **Sedimentation state**  | ( $G_z > G_T$ )                  | The flow carries _more_ sediment than it can transport — deposition occurs.                            |
| **Latent erosive state** | ( $G_z < G_T$ ) but near balance | Slight deficit in sediment load, erosion may begin but is not yet significant.                         |
Where:
- $G_z$ → **Actual sediment transport rate** (what’s currently being moved).
- $G_T$ → **Transport capacity** (maximum load flow can carry).
![[Pasted image 20251030103317.png]]
---
### Bed Shear Stress

The **bed shear stress ($\tau_0$)** represents the **tangential force per unit area** exerted by the flow on the channel bed.  
It controls sediment motion, erosion, and channel stability.

$$\begin{gather}
\tau_0 \cdot p \cdot \Delta x = \rho_w \cdot g \cdot A \cdot \sin\alpha \cdot \Delta x \\
\tau_0 = \rho_w \cdot g \cdot \frac{A}{p} \cdot \sin\alpha = \rho_w \cdot g \cdot r_{hy} \cdot S_E
\\
b \gg h \quad \Rightarrow \quad \tau_0 = \rho \cdot g \cdot h \cdot S_E
\end{gather}
$$

|Symbol|Definition|Units|
|:--|:--|:--|
|$\tau_0$|Bed shear stress|[Pa] or [N/m²]|
|$p$|Wetted perimeter|[m]|
|$\Delta x$|Channel reach length|[m]|
|$\rho_w$|Density of water (≈1000 kg/m³)|[kg/m³]|
|$g$|Acceleration due to gravity (≈9.81)|[m/s²]|
|$A$|Cross-sectional area|[m²]|
|$\alpha$|Channel bed slope angle|[° or rad]|
|$r_{hy}$|Hydraulic radius = $\dfrac{A}{p}$|[m]|
|$S_E$|Energy slope|[–]|
|$b$|Channel width|[m]|
|$h$|Mean water depth|[m]|
|$\rho$|Fluid density|[kg/m³]|

---
### Shear Velocity ($v^*$)

The **shear velocity** is an indirect measure of the flow’s ability to move sediment:

$$ v^* = \sqrt{\frac{\tau_0}{\rho}} = \sqrt{g \cdot r_{hy} \cdot S_E} $$

- Indicates the **intensity of turbulence near the bed**.
- Cannot be measured directly but is fundamental for sediment transport formulas.
- Expressed in [m/s].
---
### Critical Velocity and Critical Shear Stress

Sediment motion depends on both **particle size** and **flow strength**.

- **Too small grains:** Cohesion dominates → difficult to move.
- **Medium grains:** Most mobile → easily entrained.
- **Large grains:** Heavy → resistant to motion.
