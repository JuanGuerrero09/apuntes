# 📚Notes


In coastal and ocean engineering, water depth is classified as **deep water** or **shallow water** based on the ratio of the **water depth (h)** to the **wavelength (L)** of surface waves. When the depth is greater than half the wavelength (h/L > 1/2), the water is considered **deep**, meaning the waves do not feel the seabed and their motion is confined near the surface. When the depth is much smaller than the wavelength (h/L < 1/20), the water is classified as **shallow**, where waves are strongly influenced by the seabed. The region between these two limits (1/20 < h/L < 1/2) is known as **intermediate water**, where wave characteristics gradually transition between deep and shallow conditions.

# Introduction to River Engineering

## 🌊 Introduction to River Engineering

**River Engineering** deals with the design, construction, and management of structures and measures to improve, restore, or maintain river systems for human and environmental needs.

It aims at balancing **engineering objectives** (navigation, flood protection, water supply, energy) with **ecological sustainability** (habitat conservation, sediment continuity, and groundwater exchange).

### Main Purposes

- **Flood control:** Prevent damage and loss of life.
- **Water supply and irrigation:** Manage storage and diversion.
- **Hydropower generation:** Utilize flow and elevation difference.
- **Navigation and transport:** Maintain suitable depths and flow conditions.
- **Environmental restoration:** Reconnect floodplains, protect ecosystems.

---
## 🔁 The Hydrologic Cycle and River System

The **hydrologic cycle** describes the continuous circulation of water between the Earth and the atmosphere, driven by solar energy.  
Main processes: **Evaporation**, **Transpiration**, **Condensation**, **Precipitation**, and **Runoff**.

### Key Components of a River System

- **Channel:** The physical path through which water flows.
- **Catchment Area (Drainage Basin):** Land area that collects precipitation and directs it to a single outlet.
- **Rainfall–Runoff Relationship:** Describes how rainfall converts into streamflow; influenced by soil type, vegetation, slope, and land use.
- **Sediment Yield:** Total amount of sediment transported from the catchment to the outlet (lake, ocean).

---
## 🧭 River Classification

### 1. Based on Discharge Variation

|River Type|Discharge Behaviour|Example|Region|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Perennial (Permanent)**|Flows all year round|Amazon, Nile, Mississippi|Humid regions|
|**Intermittent (Seasonal)**|Flows only during wet seasons|Murray, Senegal|Monsoonal or Mediterranean|
|**Ephemeral (Temporary)**|Flows only after rainfall|Wadis, Arizona rivers|Arid/semi-arid|
|**Exotic**|Crosses dry areas but originates in humid zones|Nile, Colorado|Arid regions|
|**Torrential**|Sudden, violent surges|Himalayan streams|Mountainous regions|

---

### 2. Based on Location

|**River Type**|**Gradient**|**Flow Speed**|**Channel Shape**|**Sediment**|**Ecosystem**|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|**Mountain Rivers**|High|Fast|V-shaped|High erosion|Cold, clear waters, diverse fauna|
|**Floodplain Rivers**|Low|Slow|Wide, meandering|Fertile alluvium|Wetlands, high biodiversity|
|**Delta Rivers**|Very Low|Slow/Variable|Triangular or Fan-shaped|Depositional|Nutrient-rich ecosystems|
|**Tidal Rivers**|Variable|Variable|Wide, tide-influenced|Brackish sediment|Estuaries, mangroves, salt marshes|

---

### 3. Based on Planform (Channel Shape)

|**Feature**|**Straight Rivers**|**Meandering Rivers**|**Braided Rivers**|
|---|---|---|---|
|**Formation**|Found in steep terrains; flow follows geological constraints.|Formed in flatter terrain where erosion and deposition alternate.|Occur where sediment load is high and discharge fluctuates.|
|**Channel Shape**|Straight|Curved (meanders)|Interconnected channels|
|**Terrain**|Steep, mountainous|Flat plains|Glacial or sediment-rich areas|
|**Gradient**|High|Low|Moderate|
|**Sediment Transport**|High|Moderate|High|
|**Erosion/Deposition**|Erosion|Outer-bank erosion, inner-bank deposition|Constant shifting and reworking of bars|

---

## 🏞️ Longitudinal Profile and Channel Patterns

A river’s profile evolves from **steep headwaters (erosional)** to **flat floodplains (depositional)**:

|Section|Dominant Process|Typical Features|
|---|---|---|
|**Headwaters**|Erosion|V-shaped valleys, waterfalls|
|**Middle Course**|Equilibrium|Meanders, floodplains|
|**Lower Course**|Sedimentation|Deltas, estuaries|

![[Pasted image 20251101140854.png]]
**Channel Patterns**
- Straight
- Braided
- Meandering
![[Pasted image 20251101140903.png]]

## 🌀 Flow Dynamics

### Flow in a Straight Channel

- Maximum velocity at mid-depth in the center.
- Secondary rotary currents form due to sidewall friction and transverse gradients.

### Flow in Bends

- **Concave bank (outer side):** Higher velocity → erosion.
- **Convex bank (inner side):** Lower velocity → sediment deposition.
- Continuous alternation leads to **meanders (S-shaped curves)**.

![[Pasted image 20251101141010.png]]
**Channel Shifting:**  
Over time, banks erode and the entire channel migrates laterally due to **shear stress**.

---
## 🌪️ Currents in Watercourses

- **Primary current:** Main downstream flow driven by gravity and slope.
- **Secondary current:** Cross-sectional flow generated by centrifugal force.
- **Spiral current:** Helical motion transporting sediment from inner to outer banks.

---
## 🌊 Stream Channel Migration

### Cutbank (Concave Bank)

- High velocity
- High shear stress
- **Erosion zone**

### Point Bar (Convex Bank)

- Low velocity
- Low shear stress
- **Deposition zone**

This alternation of erosion and deposition causes **channel sinuosity** — the ratio of channel length to valley length.

**Neck Formation → Cutoff → Oxbow Lake Sequence:**

1. Bends grow due to continuous outer-bank erosion.
2. The “neck” narrows between adjacent meanders.
3. During flood events, the river cuts through the neck.
4. The abandoned meander becomes an **oxbow lake**.

![[Pasted image 20251101141217.png]]

---
## 🧩 Channel Pattern Characteristics

**Meandering vs. Braided Rivers:**
![[Pasted image 20251016101658.png]]

If a **meandering river** is artificially straightened:

- Velocity increases
- Erosion intensifies downstream
- Habitat diversity decreases
- Flood peaks may rise

---
## 🌿 Vegetation Zones and Groundwater Interaction

**Vegetation Distribution:**

- **High flood level:** hardwood species
- **Flood zone:** willow bushes, softwood
- **Mean water level:** reeds
- **Low water level:** pondweeds, aquatic plants

![[Pasted image 20251016102321.png]]

**Groundwater Connection:**

- Rivers and aquifers are hydraulically linked.
- During high flows, surface water **recharges groundwater**.
- During dry periods, groundwater **feeds the river**.

![[Pasted image 20251016102452.png]]

---
## 🌊 Open Channel Hydraulics

### General Energy Gradient Equation

$$
\nabla  E_n = \frac{
C}{2}\frac{
W}{g}\frac{
U^2}{r_c}
$$
Where:

- **C** = 1.5 for _subcritical flow_ and 2 for _supercritical flow_.
- **W** = channel width.
- **U** = mean velocity.
- **$r_c$** = radius of curvature.

This equation expresses the energy slope or energy gradient due to curvature and velocity distribution.

---

## ⚙️ Theoretical Principles

**Discharge (Q)** and **water level (h)** are key for:
- Flood protection and forecasting.
- Calibration of hydraulic models.
- Dam control and regulation.
- Sediment transport estimation.
- Navigation and ecological management.
A **1D approach** assumes velocity is constant along the cross-section — suitable for simple geometries.  
If velocity varies in space or time, a **2D or 3D numerical model** is required.

## 💧 Discharge Calculation in Open Channels (1D)

### Brahms / de Chézy Formula
$$v_m = C \sqrt{r_{hy}S_E}$$

Where:
- **C** = Chézy coefficient (depends on roughness and geometry).
- **$r_{hy}$** = hydraulic radius = $\frac{A}{P}$ (A = area, P = wetted perimeter).
- **$S_E$** = energy slope or energy grade line.

> Purely empirical and rarely used today — replaced by **Manning** and **Darcy-Weisbach** formulations.

![[Pasted image 20251023094330.png]]

---

### Steady and Uniform Flow
For **steady, uniform flow**:
$$S_E = S_{WS} = S_{Bed} = S$$
>Energy slope is equal to water surface slope and bed slope.

That is, the slopes of the **energy line**, **water surface**, and **channel bed** are equal.

- **Steady flow:** inflow = outflow (no storage or retention).
- **Uniform flow:** depth and velocity remain constant along the channel.
#### Steady Flow Conditions:
$$Q_{in} = Q_{out}$$
$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = 0\quad \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} = 0 \quad \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = 0 
$$
> “Time” is the defining criterion — parameters do not vary with time.
#### Uniform Flow
$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial x} = 0\quad \frac{\partial V}{\partial x} = 0 \quad \frac{\partial A}{\partial x} = 0 
$$

>“Space” is the defining criterion — parameters do not vary along the flow direction.

## 🌫️ Flow Regimes: Laminar vs Turbulent

![[Pasted image 20251023095758.png]]

Flow regime depends on the **Reynolds number (Re)** — the ratio of inertial to viscous forces.

For open channels:

$$
\begin{align}
Re = \frac{v\; 4 \; r_{hy}}{v} 
\end{align}
$$
Where:

- **v** = mean velocity
- **$r_{hy}$** = hydraulic radius (m)
- **ν** = kinematic viscosity (m²/s)

| Flow Type        | Condition       | Characteristics         |
| ---------------- | --------------- | ----------------------- |
| **Laminar**      | Re < 500        | Smooth, orderly layers  |
| **Transitional** | 500 < Re < 2000 | Mixed behaviour         |
| **Turbulent**    | Re > 2000       | Chaotic, eddy-dominated |

At **20°C**, water properties are approximately:

- Dynamic viscosity (μ) = 1.002 × 10⁻³ N·s/m²
- Kinematic viscosity (ν) = 1.004 × 10⁻⁶ m²/s
- Density (ρ) = 998 kg/m³

---

### Hydraulic Diameter and Radius

$$D_h =4\frac{A}{P_W} \quad \text{and} \quad R_h =  \frac{A}{P_W}$$ 

These describe the relationship between cross-sectional area ($A$) and wetted perimeter ($P_W$), critical in calculating resistance and flow type.

---
### Turbulent Flow Types

- **Hydraulically smooth:** roughness elements are small compared to viscous sublayer.
- **Transitional:** partial influence of roughness.
- **Hydraulically rough:** turbulence fully developed; roughness dominates friction.
---
#### 🌊 Froude Number

The **Froude number (Fr)** compares **inertial** and **gravitational** forces:
$$
Fr = \frac{v}{\sqrt{g\;h}}
$$
Where $\sqrt{g h}$ is the **wave celerity** (speed of small surface waves).

|Flow Type|Condition|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**Subcritical**|Fr < 1|Slow, deep flow; gravity dominates.|
|**Critical**|Fr = 1|Transition point; energy transfer maximum.|
|**Supercritical**|Fr > 1|Fast, shallow flow; inertia dominates.|
At **Fr = 1**, a **hydraulic jump** occurs — a sudden transition from supercritical to subcritical flow, dissipating energy.  
Wave speed: $c = \sqrt{g y}$

> **Practical test:** If a floating object can move upstream, the flow is subcritical; if it only drifts downstream, it’s supercritical.

## ⚖️ Discharge Calculation Methods

### Gauckler–Manning–Strickler Equation

$$v_m = k_{St} \; r_{hy}^{2/3} \; S_E^{1/2}$$

Where:

- **$k_{st}$** = Strickler roughness coefficient [m¹ᐟ³/s]
- **$r_{hy}$** = hydraulic radius [m]
- **$S_E$** = energy slope

**Relationship:**  
$$n = \frac{1}{k_{St}}$$
where **n** is the **Manning roughness coefficient**.

Roughness depends on material, vegetation, and geometry — it does **not change significantly with water level**.
###### Typical Roughness Coefficients ($k_{St}$)

![[Pasted image 20251101181714.png]]
![[Pasted image 20251101181722.png]]

### Darcy–Weisbach Equation

$$
v_m = \frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}}\sqrt{8 \cdot g\cdot r_{hy}\cdot S_E}
$$

Where:

- **λ** = friction factor (from **Colebrook equation**)- :

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda}} = -2.0 \log_{10}\left(\frac{k_s}{3.7 D_h} + \frac{2.51}{Re \sqrt{\lambda}}\right)$$

- **C (Chézy)** is related to λ as:

$$
C = \frac{\sqrt{8 \; g}}{\sqrt{\lambda}}
$$

> This approach accounts for roughness variation with depth — more accurate for complex natural channels.

##### Sample Calculation - Uniform Roughness

![[Pasted image 20251102175044.png]]

## 🧮 Composite Roughness in Non-Uniform Channels

When a cross-section has multiple materials or sub-sections, use **weighted averages**.

### Manning–Strickler:

$$k_{St,total} = \left[\frac{P_{total}}{\sum_{i=1}^n \left(\frac{p_i}{k_{St,i}^{3/2}}\right)}\right]^{3/2}$$
### Darcy–Weisbach:

$$\frac{1}{\sqrt{\lambda_{total}}} = \sqrt{\frac{P_{total}}{\sum_{i=1}^n (p_i \, \lambda_i)}}$$
Where:

- **pᵢ** = wetted perimeter of subsection _i_
- **$k_{st,i}$** = Strickler coefficient of subsection _i_

#### Properties of typical channel cross sections

## 🌊 Open Channel Hydraulics II

### Discharge Calculation in Open Channels

Flow discharge in open channels depends mainly on the **hydraulic radius** ($r_{hy}$) and the **energy slope** ($S_E$):

$$Q = A \cdot v_m \propto r_{hy}^{2/3} S_E^{1/2}$$

---

### Compound Channels

When a river overflows its main channel and extends onto the **floodplains**, the flow becomes **non-uniform**.  
Using a single roughness coefficient for the entire section leads to large errors since **velocity** in the floodplain and the main channel differ significantly.

The cross section is divided into **main channel**, **left bank**, and **right bank**.  
Hydraulic interaction between sub-sections can generate:

- Momentum transfer
- Interface vortices
- Secondary flow
- Shear layers
- Local velocity variations
$$
Q_{tot} = \sum ^n_{i=1} (V_{m, i} \;.\; A_i)
$$
![[Pasted image 20251030092834.png]]

This composite approach allows calculating discharge for **compound channels** more accurately.
### Channels with Vegetation

Vegetation increases resistance and decreases velocity.  
Dense or tall vegetation (trees, reeds) reduces flow efficiency and modifies turbulence patterns.  
If vegetation cannot be modeled directly, a **modified roughness coefficient ($K_{s,t}$)** is applied.
![[Pasted image 20251030093123.png]]
**Regions:**

- **Region I – Uninfluenced Zone:**  
    The flow is **not influenced by vegetation**. It occurs between $(b_v - b_m)$, close to the outer floodplain limit.
    
- **Region II – Transition Zone:**  
    The **current starts to be influenced** by vegetation. Flow velocity begins to increase toward the main channel.
    
- **Region III – Main Channel Zone:**  
    The flow becomes **fully influenced and stabilized** in the main channel.  
    Contains an **inflection point** where the velocity gradient changes before reaching the maximum $V(y)$ at the channel centerline.

## 🪨Sediment Transport

### Modes of Sediment Transport

Sediment moves in rivers depending on grain size, flow energy, and turbulence.

#### 1️⃣ Wash Load

- Fine material (silt and clay, < 0.0625 mm).
- Does **not** interact with the bed.
- Sourced from banks and watershed.
- Transported entirely in suspension.
#### 2️⃣ Bed Material Load

- Material that **interacts with the bed** and affects channel morphology.
- Divided into:
    - **Bed Load:**
        - Moves in contact with the bed (rolling, sliding, saltating).
        - Coarser material, low turbulence influence.
    - **Suspended Bed Material Load:**
        - Finer particles lifted by turbulence.
        - Occasional contact with bed.

![[Pasted image 20251030094832.png]]

![[Pasted image 20251030093848.png]]

### Morphological Forms

| Morphological form       | Condition                        | Meaning                                                                                                |
| ------------------------ | -------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Equilibrium state**    | ($G_z = G_T$)                    | Sediment input and transport capacity are balanced — no net erosion or deposition (the bed is stable). |
| **Erosive state**        | ( $G_z < G_T$ )                  | The flow can carry _more_ sediment than is available — it erodes the bed to reach capacity.            |
| **Sedimentation state**  | ( $G_z > G_T$ )                  | The flow carries _more_ sediment than it can transport — deposition occurs.                            |
| **Latent erosive state** | ( $G_z < G_T$ ) but near balance | Slight deficit in sediment load, erosion may begin but is not yet significant.                         |
Where:
- $G_z$ → **Actual sediment transport rate** (what’s currently being moved).
- $G_T$ → **Transport capacity** (maximum load flow can carry).
![[Pasted image 20251030103317.png]]
---
### Bed Shear Stress

The **bed shear stress ($\tau_0$)** represents the **tangential force per unit area** exerted by the flow on the channel bed.  
It controls sediment motion, erosion, and channel stability.

$$\begin{gather}
\tau_0 \cdot p \cdot \Delta x = \rho_w \cdot g \cdot A \cdot \sin\alpha \cdot \Delta x \\
\tau_0 = \rho_w \cdot g \cdot \frac{A}{p} \cdot \sin\alpha = \rho_w \cdot g \cdot r_{hy} \cdot S_E
\\
b \gg h \quad \Rightarrow \quad \tau_0 = \rho \cdot g \cdot h \cdot S_E
\end{gather}
$$

|Symbol|Definition|Units|
|:--|:--|:--|
|$\tau_0$|Bed shear stress|[Pa] or [N/m²]|
|$p$|Wetted perimeter|[m]|
|$\Delta x$|Channel reach length|[m]|
|$\rho_w$|Density of water (≈1000 kg/m³)|[kg/m³]|
|$g$|Acceleration due to gravity (≈9.81)|[m/s²]|
|$A$|Cross-sectional area|[m²]|
|$\alpha$|Channel bed slope angle|[° or rad]|
|$r_{hy}$|Hydraulic radius = $\dfrac{A}{p}$|[m]|
|$S_E$|Energy slope|[–]|
|$b$|Channel width|[m]|
|$h$|Mean water depth|[m]|
|$\rho$|Fluid density|[kg/m³]|

---
### Shear Velocity ($v^*$)

The **shear velocity** is an indirect measure of the flow’s ability to move sediment:

$$ v^* = \sqrt{\frac{\tau_0}{\rho}} = \sqrt{g \cdot r_{hy} \cdot S_E} $$

- Indicates the **intensity of turbulence near the bed**.
- Cannot be measured directly but is fundamental for sediment transport formulas.
- Expressed in [m/s].
---
### Critical Velocity and Critical Shear Stress

Sediment motion depends on both **particle size** and **flow strength**.

- **Too small grains:** Cohesion dominates → difficult to move.
- **Medium grains:** Most mobile → easily entrained.
- **Large grains:** Heavy → resistant to motion.

## Sediment Transport (Continuation)

Sediment transport describes how particles on the channel bed (sand, gravel, silt) begin to move, under which flow conditions motion occurs, and how bed forms and erosion patterns evolve.

The driving force is the **bed shear stress**, which depends on the flow energy:$$
\tau_0 = \rho_w g \frac{A}{P}\sin\alpha = \rho_w g\, r_{hy}\, S_E$$
where:
- $\rho_w$ = water density
- $g$ = gravity
- $A$ = wetted area
- $P$ = wetted perimeter
- $r_{hy}$ = hydraulic radius
- $S_E$ = energy slope

### Sediment Classes

Sediments originate from mechanical weathering of rock.

- **Very coarse soil** — boulders, cobbles, coarse gravels
- **Coarse soil (granular)** — sands and gravels
- **Fine soil (cohesive)** — silts and clays dominated by electrochemical bonding

---
### Critical Shear Stress

The **critical shear stress** is the minimum shear needed to initiate particle motion.  
It depends on grain size, shape, density, cohesion, and flow regime.

Two dimensionless groups are relevant:

- **Sedimentological Froude Number** → indicates interaction of flow velocity with bed-form wave propagation.

- **Sedimentological Reynolds Number** → determines whether viscosity or turbulence dominates at the grain scale.    

---
### Bed Load Motion

Bed load motion occurs when the **Shields parameter** $\tau_*$ exceeds its critical value:
$$\tau_* = \frac{u_*^2}{(s-1)g d_S} = \frac{\tau_0}{(\rho_s - \rho_w) g\, d_S}$$
where:

- $u_*$ = shear velocity
- $s = \rho_s / \rho_w$ = relative density of sediment
- $d_S$ = characteristic grain size

Condition for motion:

$$\tau_* > (\tau_*)_c$$
#### Explanation of the Shields Diagram

The **Shields diagram** is a fundamental tool to determine the onset of sediment motion.  
It relates:

- **x-axis:** particle-scale Reynolds number
$$Re_* = \frac{u_* d}{\nu}​$$
- **y-axis:** Shields parameter $\tau_*$

The curve $(\tau_c, Re)$ marks the threshold for incipient motion.

Interpretation:

- Fine sediments → viscous effects dominate → higher $(\tau_*)_c$.    
- Coarse sediments → turbulent regime → $(\tau_*)_c$ approaches ~0.045 (almost constant).
- If $\tau_* < (\tau_*)_c$ → **no movement**.
- If $\tau_* > (\tau_*)_c$ → **sediment begins to move**, accelerating as shear increases.
---
### Sediment Transport Curve

**Meyer–Peter Müller (MPM)**

Bed-load transport rate:

$$
m_G = \frac{8}{\sqrt{\rho_w}} \cdot \frac{\rho_s}{(\rho_s-\rho_w)\cdot g}\cdot (\rho_w\cdot g \cdot r_{hy}\cdot I - 0.047 \cdot (\rho_s-\rho_w) \cdot g \cdot d_{65})^{3/2}
$$
Interpretation:

- If the term in parentheses is **positive**, there is excess shear → **sediment moves**.
- If the term is **negative**, the square root is undefined → **no transport**.

The four diagrams shown represent:

1. **Discharge–duration curve**
2. **Discharge–stage curve**
3. **Sediment transport–duration curve**
4. **Sediment transport curve**

Example:

> Sediment transported at $Q = 200\ \mathrm{m^3/s}$ → approx. **2 kg/s** (from the supplied curve).

### Characteristic Sediment Diameter

Diámetro característico ponderado:

$$d_{ch} = \frac{\sum_{i=1}^n(\Delta p_i \cdot d_{k,i})}{100\%}$$

### Bed Shear Stress ↔ Bed Form

- Flat
- Ripples
- Ripples on dunes
- Dunes
- Flat dunes
- Flat bottom
- Antidunes
![[Pasted image 20251106100926.png]]
> _Ripples only appear if $d_{50}$ is fine (sand)._

---
### Influence of Geometric Changes on Sediment Transport

Geometric changes in the channel alter shear stress, which affects sediment transport, bar formation (sandbanks), and scour patterns.

![[Pasted image 20251106102852.png]]

- **Sandbank for LWL** → formation of shallow bars during low-water levels
- **Scour** → erosion due to local increases in flow velocity or turbulence
---
### Scouring at Piers/Bridges
Types of scour:

- **Local scour** – erosion occurring directly around bridge piers or abutments due to flow acceleration and vortex formation. This is the most common scour mechanism.
    - **Clear-water scour** – no sediment from upstream enters the scour zone.
    - **Live-bed scour** – sediment is continuously supplied to the scour zone from upstream.
- **Contraction scour** – erosion caused by narrowing of a river or channel, which increases the flow velocity and the sediment transport capacity.
- **General scour** – overall degradation of the riverbed across the bridge site, often due to long-term or natural changes in the flow regime.

---
#### Calculation Approach

$$d_S = K_{yW} K_I K_d K_s K_\theta K_G$$
where:

- $d_S$ → depth of scour
- $K_{yW}$ → parameter for the effect of water depth
- $K_I$ → parameter for flow intensity (based on $v_{crit}$)
- $K_d$ → parameter accounting for sediment particle characteristics
- $K_s$ → parameter for pier shape
- $K_\theta$ → parameter for flow angle
- $K_G$ → parameter for geometrical effects of the pier

# Hydraulic Structures

## Waterway Transportation Engineering

### Fixed Weirs and Stilling Basins

#### Definition of a Weir

A **weir** is a hydraulic structure that creates a controlled upstream water level and forces flow over a crest. It is typically used for **flow regulation, water level control, flood protection**, and **energy dissipation**

#### Types of Weirs (with definitions)

- **In-river solution**  
    A fixed structure built directly in the riverbed for water level control and flow measurement.
- **Piano-key weir**  
    A high-efficiency weir with zig-zag lateral geometry that increases discharge capacity without raising crest height.
- **Labyrinth weir**  
    A folded-planform weircrest that lengthens the spillway crest to pass more flow for the same head.
- **Flood-protection spillway**  
    A bypass spillway that diverts excess floodwater into another channel or relief basin.
- **Pre-lock weir**  
    A structure that prevents sediment inflow into a lock’s retention area, ensuring navigational safety.
- **Dam and spillway**  
    A crest integrated into a dam to regulate reservoir water levels and release excess water.

---
### Hydraulics of Fixed Weirs

A fixed weir produces **free overflow** when water overtops the crest. The **energy head** above the crest determines the discharge.

![[Pasted image 20251119100222.png]]

**Energy head:**
$$h_E = h + \frac{v_0^2}{2g}$$
In most cases $v_0 \approx 0$, so $h_E \approx h$.

#### Discharge Formula (General Poleni Equation)
$$Q = \frac{2}{3} \, \mu_E \, b \, \sqrt{2g} \, h_E^{3/2}$$
For negligible approach velocity:
$$Q = \frac{2}{3} \mu \, b \sqrt{2g} \, h^{3/2}$$
Where:
- Q: discharge (m³/s)
- $\mu$: weir coefficient
- b: crest width
- h: overtopping head

---

### Weir Coefficients

![[Pasted image 20251119100414.png]]

Typical values:

- **0.49–0.51** sharp-edged horizontal crest
- **0.50–0.55** wide crest, well-rounded edges
- **0.65–0.73** fully rounded crest
- **0.64** sharp-edged, ventilated nappe
- **0.73–0.75** round-crowned, vertical upstream, inclined downstream
- **0.75–0.79** roof-shaped crest

The value of $\mu$ depends on crest shape, approach flow, and aeration of the nappe.

---

### Complete vs Incomplete Overtopping

![[Pasted image 20251119101126.png]]
- **Complete overtopping**  
    The flow fully separates from the upstream face → ventilated nappe → regular Poleni flow.
- **Incomplete overtopping**  
    Upstream submergence reduces overflow capacity.
Correction factor:

$$c = (1-[\frac{h_u}{h}]^x)^y = f(\text{Form}, \frac{h_u}{h})$$
Where c adjusts the weir coefficient for upstream submergence.

![[Pasted image 20251119101203.png]]


---

### Flow Under Weirs (Undershot Flow)

Flow beneath a gate follows **Torricelli’s law**:
$$Q = \mu \, a \, b \, \sqrt{2 g h_0}$$
Where:

- a: opening height
- b: width
- h_0h0​: upstream head
- μ: composite coefficient
    μ=ϕ ψ
    - ϕ: energy-loss coefficient
    - ψ: constriction coefficient
![[Pasted image 20251119101223.png]]

Torricelli 

$$Q = \mu \cdot a \cdot b \cdot \sqrt{2g \cdot h_0}$$
\mu includes the \psi and \phi coefficients

a -> opening height
b -> opening width
phi -> loss coefficient
psi -> constriction coefficient
mu -> weir coefficient

---

### Backed-Up Outflow

When downstream water level submerges the outlet, the discharge becomes:

$$Q = \mu_u \cdot a \cdot b \cdot \sqrt{2g \cdot h_0}$$

The coefficient μu\mu_uμu​ depends on the ratio h0​/a and on downstream submergence h2​/h0​.

**Why 90° gates?**  
A vertical gate minimizes contraction effects and maintains a predictable velocity distribution.

---
### Components of a Fixed Weir

> **Explanation of each part**

- **Headwater (Upper Water Body)**  
    Upstream region controlling the available head.
- **Fixed Weir Body**  
    Crest section where overflow begins. Controls overtopping and discharge.
- **Overflow Jet**  
    Free nappe that falls into the stilling basin.
- **Stilling Basin**  
    Structure designed to **force a hydraulic jump** for energy dissipation.
- **Tailwater (Lower Water Body)**  
    Downstream flow condition that determines jump location.

Additional structural elements:

- **Indentation/Threshold** → stabilizes jump formation
- **End sill** → reduces scour by stabilizing jump toe
- **Appurtenances** for aeration or energy dissipation

### Overflow Head and Cavitation Risk

To prevent cavitation:

1. $h < h_d$: **positive pressure**
2. $h = h_d$​: **atmospheric pressure**
3. $h > h_d$​: **negative pressure → cavitation risk**

$$h_d \geq 0.8$$
![[Pasted image 20251118131543.png]]

- Discharge coefficient  of the Standard profile (WES)
![[Pasted image 20251118133404.png]]

### Stilling Basin

A **stilling basin** forces a **hydraulic jump** to dissipate energy safely.

> Purpose: convert supercritical flow into subcritical flow while preventing scour.

---
### Theory of Conjugate Depths

The conjugate depths $h_i$​ and $h_o$​ satisfy momentum and energy equations.

![[Pasted image 20251118134605.png]]

**Bernoulli**

$$
h_0+\frac{v_o^2}{2 \cdot g}+e=h_i+\frac{v_i^2}{2 \cdot g} + h_v
$$
Iterative form:

$$hi=\sqrt{\frac{(1+\zeta)^2\cdot q^2}{2 \cdot g \cdot (h_{E,O}+e-h_i)}}$$
Where:

- $v_i = \frac{Q}{b h_i}$
- ζ: energy loss factor
- e: elevation to control jump position

---

### Supportive Force Set (Momentum Equation)

Momentum balance:

$$
\rho Qv_i + \frac{1}{2}\rho g h_o^2 b = \rho Q  v_ö + \frac{1}{2}\rho g h_ö^2 b 
$$
Conjugate depth ratio:

$$
\frac{h_ö}{h_i} = 1/2 [\sqrt{8 Fr_i^2+1}-1]
$$

Degree of ponding: $\epsilon$ 

$$1,05 \leq \epsilon = \frac{h_u+e}{h_ö}\leq 1,25$$

Interpretation:

- ϵ<1.05 → jump drifts downstream → scour risk
- ϵ>1.25 → jump moves upstream → impact on spillway

---

### Required Length of Hydraulic Jump

Empirical formulas:

- Safranez: $L_T \approx 5.2 h_o$
- Bakhmetef: $L_T \approx 6 (h_o - h_i)$
- Smetana: $L_T \approx 5.6 h_o$
- Page: $L_T \approx 5 (h_o - h_i)$

---

#### Hydraulic Jump as an Energy Dissipater

The analytical equation of the energy dissipated with the hydraulic jump is,

$$\nabla E = \frac{(h_o - h_i)^3}{4 h_i h_o}$$

The power lost by hydraulic jump can be calculated by,

$$P = \gamma_w Q \nabla E$$

Where:

$\gamma_w​$ = Specific weight of water = 9.81 kN/m³  
$\Delta E$ = Energy dissipated as head (m)  
Q = Discharge (m³/sec)  
P = Power dissipated (kW)

---
### Types of Hydraulic Jump

1. **Undular / Wavy Jump (Fr = 1–1.7)**  
    Weak undulations, ~5% energy dissipation.
2. **Weak Jump (Fr = 1.7–2.5)**  
    Small rollers, ~20% dissipation.
3. **Oscillating Jump (Fr = 2.5–4.5)**  
    Unstable oscillations, 20–40% dissipation.
4. **Steady Jump (Fr = 4.5–9)**  
    Most efficient and stable. 45–70% dissipation.
5. **Strong Jump (Fr > 9)**  
    Violent turbulence, 70–85% dissipation. Avoided in structures.
