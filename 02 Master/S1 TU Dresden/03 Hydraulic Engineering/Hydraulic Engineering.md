# 📖Summary
### Contents and qualification aims

for flood protection (levees, water retention reservoirs) and for use of water (weirs, dams, water power stations) are discussed with respect to water management, ecological and economic aspects. Environmentally friendly structures, sustainability and renewable energies are dealt with emphasis. In addition navigation engineering systems are introduced. The students have knowledge about the design, operation and calculation of hydraulic structures.

### Module character

# 📚Notes



1. Introduction to River Engineering
2. Hydraulic Structures
3. Introduction to Waterways Engineering

In coastal and ocean engineering, water depth is classified as **deep water** or **shallow water** based on the ratio of the **water depth (h)** to the **wavelength (L)** of surface waves. When the depth is greater than half the wavelength (h/L > 1/2), the water is considered **deep**, meaning the waves do not feel the seabed and their motion is confined near the surface. When the depth is much smaller than the wavelength (h/L < 1/20), the water is classified as **shallow**, where waves are strongly influenced by the seabed. The region between these two limits (1/20 < h/L < 1/2) is known as **intermediate water**, where wave characteristics gradually transition between deep and shallow conditions.
