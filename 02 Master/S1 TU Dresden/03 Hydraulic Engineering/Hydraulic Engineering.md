# 📖Summary
### Contents and qualification aims

for flood protection (levees, water retention reservoirs) and for use of water (weirs, dams, water power stations) are discussed with respect to water management, ecological and economic aspects. Environmentally friendly structures, sustainability and renewable energies are dealt with emphasis. In addition navigation engineering systems are introduced. The students have knowledge about the design, operation and calculation of hydraulic structures.
