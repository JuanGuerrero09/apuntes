## Hydropower Plants: Capacity and Surge Height Calculation

From head net head is with 5% losses

Max specific rotational frequency
$$
n_{q, max} = 850 \cdot \frac{1}{h_{netto}}
$$
Calculate rotational frequency

$$
n = n_q \frac{h_{netto}^{3/4}}{n_{q,max}}
$$
Round n towards the synchronized rotational frequency

TO COMPLETE

Sincronized velocity -> recalculate specific rotational frequenc y

given data for the project site: natural river: natural slope: IR = 1 ‰ roughness: kSt = 40 m1/3/s embankment: 1:m = 1:5 bed width: b = 20 m turbine data (Kaplan): Mean discharge: MQ = 20 m³/s Mean lower discharge:   MLQ = 3 m³/s length river: L = 5 km (Stretch) artificial channel: degree of expansion (power plant): fA = 1,5 length: Lc = 1 km bed width: bc = 10 m artificial slope: Ic = 0,14 ‰ embankment: 1:mc = 1:2 roughness: kSt,c = 70 m1/3/s discharge fish pass A: Qfish,a = 0,15 m³/s 

1) capacity of the power plant 
 
Assumption: the bed level at the intake structure is kept for the whole upper artificial channel (exact position of the power plant within the channel is unknown) 

Minimum ecological Enviromental flow = 1/3 of minimum flow discharge 


In exam no efficiency are given, you can assume around 0.8/85/9


### Surge Height Calculation

Possible scenarios:
a) “opening” of turbine leads to surge wave into  the downstream channel b) “closing” of turbine leads to drawdown in the downstream channel c) “opening” of turbine leads to drawdown in the upstream channel d) “closing” of turbine leads to surge wave into the upstream channel 

$$
V_{w(u,d)} = v_{u, d} \pm \sqrt{g\cdot h_{u,d}}
$$
Being u upstream and d downstream

degree of expansion turbine plant?
