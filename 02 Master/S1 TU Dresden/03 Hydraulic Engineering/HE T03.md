## Tutorial 3: Open Channel Flow

### Exercise 1

A rectangular channel is 3.0 wide, slope of $S=0.01$, flowrate of $5.3 m3/s$ and $n = 0.011 s/m^{1/3}$. Find it's normal depth $y_n$ and the critical $y_c$

#### Manning Strickler Equation

$$
\begin{gather}
Q = \frac{1}{n}\cdot A \cdot r_{hy}^{2/3} \cdot S_o^{1/2} \\
\text{being } r_{hy} = \frac{b * y_n}{} 

\end{gather}
$$

$$
Fr = \frac{v}{\sqrt{g \cdot h}} = 1 = \frac{Q}{A \sqrt{g \cdot h}}
$$

### Exercise 2

Water flows in rectangular channel at a depth of 1.22 m and discharge of Q = 5.66 m^3/2, determine minimum channel width to be subcritical

1. Calculate critical area with critical flow
2. Calculate b with that

### Exercise 3

Calculate critical depth y_c, critical velocity and criitical slope is fhte dischare in a trapezoidal Channes is about Q=10m^3/s, width 3.0, manning 0.025 s/m^{1/3} and the side slope 1:2 

y_c = 0.79, calc s_c and v_c

### Exercise 4

A rectangular channel has a bottom width of 8.0 m and Manning's n = 0.025 s/m^{1/3}

a) Normal slope at normal depth of y_n = 2.0 m when the discharge is 12 m3/s
b) determine critical slope S_c and critical depth y_c

S = 8.74%
c) Deternime critical slope Sc at a criditcal depth of yC_ = 1.5 m and corresponding discharege

### Exercise 5

Show the best dimensions of the best hdyraulic section of a rectangular channel

wp = b + 2 h
Qmax -> Wpmin

B=2H
### Exercise 6

ALCULATE THE PROPORTIOS¡S OF A RECTANGULAR CHANNEL THAT WILL MINIMIZE EXCAVATION AN RESULT IN OPTIMUM HYDRAULIC SECTION


b) If the computed corss sectional geometry ....

> Best of all is the one that has biggest r_hy and lower w_p
