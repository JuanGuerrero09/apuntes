## Introduction to River Engineering

**River Engineering** deal with the design and construction of structures to restore or improve rivers for human and environmental need.

River engineering supports the sustainable development managing rivers for:
- Flood control
- Water supply
- Engergy
- Transport

### Keys processes for hydrologic cycle
The [[Hydrology#2. Hydrologic Cycle | Hydrological Cycle]] or _water cycle_ is the continuous circulation of water in the Earth-Atmosphere. Is the motion of the water from the ground to atmosphere and back again.

Involves key processes driven by energy of the sun:
- Evaporation
- Transpiration
- Condensation
- Precipitation
- Runoff

## Largest and Longest Rivers/Streams on the Earth


| **According to River Length** | Avg. Q |     |     |
| ----------------------------- | ------ | --- | --- |
|                               |        |     |     |

## River System

Channel: The physical passage through which water flows

Catchment Area: (or drainage basin) is the total area of land where precipitation collects and drains into a particular river or stream. 

Rainfall-Runoff:  rainfall-runoff relationship describes how rainfall translates into river flow. Several factors affect the runoff such as soil type, land cover, and slope.

Sediment Yield: Total amount of sediment (soil, sand, rocks) transported by the river from its catchment area to its outlet, such as a lake or ocean.


## River Classification

### By variation of discharge


| River Type              | Discharge Behaviour | Example | Region |
| ----------------------- | ------------------- | ------- | ------ |
| Perennial (_permanent_) |                     |         |        |
| Intermittent (Seasonal) |                     |         |        |
| Ephemeral (Temporary)   |                     |         |        |
| Exotic                  |                     |         |        |
| Torrential              |                     |         |        |


### By location


| River Type        | Gradient | Flow Speed | Channel Shape | Sediment | Ecosystem |
| ----------------- | -------- | ---------- | ------------- | -------- | --------- |
| Mountain Rivers   |          |            |               |          |           |
| Floodplain Rivers |          |            |               |          |           |
| Delta Rivers      |          |            |               |          |           |
| Tidal Rivers      |          |            |               |          |           |
### By planform


| River Type | Discharge Behaviour | Example | Region |
| ---------- | ------------------- | ------- | ------ |
|            |                     |         |        |

## Longitudinal Profile and Channel Patterns

Headwaters (_Erosion_)

Middle course (_Equilibrium_)

Lower course and erosion base (_Sedimentation_)

Channel Pattersn
- Straight channel
- Braided channel
- Meandering channel



### Flow in a Straight Channel
- High velocity in the middle of section
- Due transverse gradient from the sides to the center, transverse rotary currents developed
### Flow in bends
ÔÉº
Every alluvial river tends to develop bends, which are characterized by
scouring on the concave side and silting on the convex side
ÔÉº
The silting in bends may continue due to the action of centrifugal
force.
ÔÉº
The successive bends of the reverse order are formed. It ultimately
leads to the development of a complete S-curve called a meander.

#### Channel shifting

Due shear stress the banks is eroded and shifted 

## Currents in water courses 

- Primary Current:
- Secondary Current
- Spiral current:

Water moves to outer bank of the rivers and exist a delta in elevation
## Stream Channel Migration

In the **Cutbank** (_Concave Bank_):

In the **Point bar** (_Convex Bank_)


From the erosion and sedimentation creates the *sinuous course*

**Neck formation**

**Cutoff**

**Oxbow Lake Formation**

# üê¢ Definitions

River : large natural stream of water that carries a huge quantity of water drained by the catchments as runoff. They take off from Mountains, flow through plains, and finally join an ocean, sea, lake, or another river.

Sinuosity:

Still water: 

Groyne
