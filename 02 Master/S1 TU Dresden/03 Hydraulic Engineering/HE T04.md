## Spillway Design

Factors affecting the required spillway capacity

- inflow hydrograam
etc

Types of Spillways

- Purpose
	- Main or service spillway
	- Auxiliary spillway

- Control
	- Controlled
	- Uncontrolled



why we prefer a kind of spillwat <- EXAM QUESTION


Exercise - Overflow spillway

Design a weir system on a river with an overflow spillway. If a flood occurs (Discharge BHQ=8 m³/s) the water high over the river bed should not exceed 4.5 [m]. The shape of the crest profile is to be designed for optimal discharge capacity. Subsequently the stilling basin should be dimensioned.

![[Pasted image 20260113135313.png]]
width (length) of the overflow crest: bw = b = 10 m 
inclination factor/side slope: m = 5 
gradient: I = 0.0002 
design flood: BHQ = 8 m³/s 
Manning-value: n = 1 35 𝑠 𝑚 1 3 = 0.0286 𝑚 1 3
