Fix point Calculation

Basically for bends in the pipeline

given data:

1) Calculate flow areas in both pipes
2) Mean flow velocities
3) Get Reynolds number
4) Get roughness coefficient from simplified Colebrook-White
5) Friction fore between flowing water and pipe wall
6) Get hydrostatic forces
	1) Hydrostatic pressure without pressure surge
7) Calculate momentum forces
8) Expansion forces in the stuffing boxes
9) Pipe dead wight force parallel to pipe axes
10) Friction force in stuffing box
11) Frictional force in fix point/bearings from dead weight and water filling
12) Summary forces parallel to pipe axis
