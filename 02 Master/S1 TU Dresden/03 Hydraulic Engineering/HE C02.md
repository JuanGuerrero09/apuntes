## Open Channel Hydraulics

### Recall from previous class

- *Main Current* : Main flow of water by gravity and slope of riverbed
- *Secondary current*: Lateral flows, perpendicular to river bed, generated by primary flow interacting with riverbed, banks or obstacles in water
- *Spiral Current*:

$$
\nabla  E_n = \frac{
C}{2}\frac{
W}{g}\frac{
U^2}{r_c}
$$
Being C equal to 1.5 for subcritical flow and equal to 2 for supercritical flow.

- *Cutbank* - outside of meander (Concave bank)
- *Point bar* (Convex Bank)
- Sinuosity

### Open Channel Hydraulics - Theoretical Principles.

Discharge and water level data important for all fields of hydraulic engineering:
- flood protection
- calibration of numerical models
- control rules of dams
- sediment transport
- navigation
- ecological issues
>1D Approach works good for simple cross sections, easy approach

1D: Velocity is constant along the cross section

If velocity changes in space and time is not possible to do a 1D, need 2D or 3D approach.
For more than 1D you need numerical approach not analytical.

### Discharge Calculation in Open Channels (1D)

Brahms / de Ch√©zy:
$$v_m = C \sqrt{r_{hy}S_E}$$

![[Pasted image 20251023094330.png]]

Being:
- C: Ch√©zy coef (includes roughness and geometry variation
- $r_{hy}$ hydraulic radius $r_{hy} = \frac{A}{p}$ 
- $S_E$ = Energy grade /energy slope

For Steady - Uniform Flow:
$$S_E = S_{WS} = S_{Bed} = S$$
>Energy slope is equal to water surface slope and bed slope.

#### Steady Flow
$$Q_{in} = Q_{out}$$
No storage, no retention and no darining or emptiying of the channel.

*Time* works as the criteria
$$
\frac{\partial y}{\partial t} = 0\quad \frac{\partial V}{\partial t} = 0 \quad \frac{\partial A}{\partial t} = 0 
$$
#### Uniform Flow

#### Laminar and Turbulent Flow

![[Pasted image 20251023095758.png]]
Depends on the **Reynolds Number** for describe the degree of turbulent in a certain flow, the inertial forces vs the viscous flow

$$
\begin{align}
Re = \frac{v\; d_{hy}}{v} \text{-> Circular pipe} \\
Re = \frac{v\; 4 \; r_{hy}}{v} \text{-> Open channels } 
\end{align}
$$
*Hydraulic diameter*:
$$D_h$$

*Hydraulic radius*:
$$R_h$$
##### Turbulent Flow Types
*Hydraulically smooth*
*Transient state*
*Hydraulically rough*

#### Froude Number
$$
Fr = \frac{v}{\sqrt{g\;h}}
$$
Where sqrt gh is the wave propagation velocity. Inertial forces vs gravitational forces

$$\begin{align}
Fr<1 \quad \text{subcritical flow} \\
Fr=1 \quad \text{critical flow (hj)} \\
Fr>1 \quad \text{supercritical flow}
\end{align}$$

Fr = 1 is the hydraulic jump.
*Wave speed*: $c = \sqrt{gy}$ 

>Check channel design by Fr and pydraulics

If you throw anything to a channel and see backward wave is subcritical, if it goes only downstream is supercritical.

*Gauckler-Manning-Strickler*
k Coef include roughness, channel irregularities and internal friction. K_St not vary with a change in water level

1/stricler coef = manning value

_Darcy-Weisbach_ 
$\lambda$ from colebrook formula

Roughness changes with water dept, more sophisticated approach

$$
C = \frac{\sqrt{8 \; g}}{\sqrt{\lambda}}
$$
