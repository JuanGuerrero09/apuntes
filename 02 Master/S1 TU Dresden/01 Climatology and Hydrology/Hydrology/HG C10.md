## 7. Runoff

**Runoff** is the surface and sub surface flow from a catchment, typically measured at a river cross-section

Relevant things:

- Discharge: flow measured in a stream at the catchment outlet
- runoff hydrograph: time series of runoff
- hydrograph analysis: allows to quantify fast and slow components, flow and drougths, flow duration curves and cumulative mass diagrams
- Runoff is main component of water balance P = ETR + R (and it can be determined most reliably)

### 7.1 Runoff measurements

Importance of accurate data collection

Consideration for measuring dicharge

- site selection
- measurement type/frequency

Methodology
1) measuring stage



2) measuring (derive) stream flow / velocity
- Discharge derived from flow velocity
- Area-velocity-method
for each section
$A_i = w_i \cdot d \; $


3) deriving stage-discharege relationship


Stage discharge curve -> assumes unsteady uniform flow (variable in time with flow parameters constant in space)
