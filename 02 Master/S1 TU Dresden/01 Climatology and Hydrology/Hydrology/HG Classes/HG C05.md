# 📒Class Summary

This lecture introduces the fundamental processes responsible for the formation of precipitation and the measurement methods used in hydrology. It explains how atmospheric uplifting mechanisms create condensation and droplet growth, describes different precipitation regimes across climates, and presents key hydrological measurement concepts such as rainfall intensity, depth, and duration.

# 📝 Notes

## 6. Precipitation

Precipitation is the **primary input** to the hydrological cycle and determines the **water balance** of any basin.  
It occurs in various forms:
- Rain
- Fog
- Snow, sleet
- Hailstones
- Freezing rain
Every precipitation event is characterized by:
- **Volume or depth** (mm)
- **Duration** (minutes to days)
- **Intensity** (mm/hr)
- **Return period** (statistical recurrence)

### 6.1 Formation of precipitation

The formation of precipitation depends on three major processes: **cooling**, **condensation**, and **droplet growth**.

#### 1) Cooling of moist air to dew-point temperature
Air must be cooled until it reaches saturation. Cooling can occur through:
- **Radiation:** heat loss to the atmosphere, especially during nighttime
- **Conduction:** transfer of heat to a colder surface
- **Mixing:** warm moist air mixing with cold dry air
- **Adiabatic cooling:** temperature drop caused by vertical uplift and expansion of air
Of all these mechanisms, **adiabatic cooling is the most significant**, because strong cooling rates occur mainly when air rises in the atmosphere.

#### 2) Condensation
Once air reaches dew point, water vapor condenses into small droplets.
- Droplet diameter: $\phi = 0.001–0.2\ \text{mm}$
- Fall velocity: $v < 0.7\ \text{m/s}$
- Requires **condensation nuclei** (dust, salt, smoke, pollen)
    - Typical diameter: $> 10^{-4}\ \text{mm}$
Condensation nuclei are essential because water vapor alone cannot easily form droplets; the nuclei reduce the energy barrier required for condensation.

#### 3) Droplet growth
For precipitation to occur, droplets must grow large enough to fall.
- Droplet diameter: $\phi = 0.4–4\ \text{mm}$
- Fall velocity: $v > 1\ \text{m/s}$
- Growth mechanisms include:
    - Collision and coalescence
    - Ice-crystal processes
    - Continued condensation

### Meteorological uplift situations

Uplift mechanisms force air to rise, cool, and ultimately condense.

#### Convective lifting

- Warm moist air rises due to surface heating    
- Air expands and cools adiabatically
- Forms cumulonimbus clouds
- Generates short-duration, high-intensity rainfall
- Spatially limited
- Produces showers, intense rainfall, and hail
#### Orographic lifting

- Occurs when moist air encounters a mountain barrier
- Air rises up the slope → cools → condenses → precipitation
- Influenced by:
    - Wind speed
    - Acclivity (steepness)
    - Elevation
- Can produce large intensity and long-duration rainfall
- Leeward side becomes dry due to **rain shadow**
#### Frontal lifting

Precipitation associated with atmospheric fronts and cyclonic systems.
- **Warm front:**
    - Warm moist air glides over cold dense air
    - Produces uniform, widespread rainfall of moderate intensity
- **Cold front:**
    - Cold air pushes under warm moist air, forcing rapid uplift
    - Produces intense, short-lived precipitation events

#### Convergence

- Occurs when air flows together into a low-pressure region
- Air is forced upward
- Common in tropical storms and cyclones

### 6.2 Precipitation measurements

#### Precipitation regimes

The table classifies global precipitation regimes and their seasonal patterns.
Interpretation of abbreviations:
- **Wi** = Winter
- **Su** = Summer
- **max** = Maximum precipitation in that season
- **dry / wet** = Seasonal dryness or wetness

| --- | Climate                | Precipitation                   |
| --- | ---------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| A   | Equatorial             | All year, max 2 seasons         |
| B1  | Tropical (inner, 10º)  | Wi dry, Su wet, 2 summer max    |
| B2  | Tropical (outer, 23º)  | 1 summer max, longer dry season |
| C   | Monsoon                | high Su max, long dry season    |
| D   | Subtropical (23-30º)   | dry (desert) very little rain   |
| E   | Mediterranean (30-40º) | Wi rain, Su dry                 |
| F   | Mid-latitudes          | all seasons                     |
| G   | Polar                  | all seasons, small amounts      |
Clarification:  
"Summer max" means **summer has the highest rainfall of the year**.  
"Wi dry" means **winter is dry**, "Su wet" means **summer is wet**, etc.

#### Point measurements

##### Rainfall depth
Total accumulated precipitation during an event or time interval (mm).
##### Rainfall intensity
Rate of precipitation:
- $[\text{mm/min}]$
- $[\text{mm/hr}]$
Intensity is especially important for stormwater design and runoff modeling.
##### Rainfall duration
Total time over which precipitation occurs.
##### Rain yield factor
Units: $\text{mm·s}^{-1}\text{·ha}^{-1}$  
Used to estimate the volume of stormwater generated from rainfall over a catchment.  
Less common today but still appears in older hydrological references.

# 💡 Key Takeaways

- Precipitation formation requires cooling → condensation → droplet growth.
- Adiabatic cooling during vertical uplift is the dominant mechanism behind rainfall.
- Uplift processes (convective, orographic, frontal, convergence) determine rainfall intensity and spatial distribution.
- Global climate regimes show distinct seasonal precipitation patterns.
- Hydrological measurements such as depth, intensity, and duration are essential for modeling runoff and designing water infrastructure.

### Conceptual Understanding

- What atmospheric processes determine whether condensation results in cloud formation but not precipitation?
- Why does air cool as it rises? How does this relate to the adiabatic lapse rate?

# 🐢 Definitions

- **nuclei**: tiny particles like dust, salt, or smoke that act as a surface for water vapor to condense upon, forming cloud droplets
- **adiabatic cooling**: Temperature decrease caused by the expansion of rising air. No heat is exchanged with the environment. It is the dominant mechanism that triggers condensation and cloud formation.
- **cumulonimbus** : A tall, vertically developed convective cloud associated with thunderstorms, heavy rain, lightning, and hail. Forms when warm moist air rises rapidly.
- **dew point**: The temperature at which air reaches saturation and condensation begins.
- **condensation**: The phase change from water vapor to liquid droplets once saturation is achieved.
- **rain shadow**: A dry region on the leeward side of a mountain where descending air warms and reduces relative humidity, preventing precipitation.
