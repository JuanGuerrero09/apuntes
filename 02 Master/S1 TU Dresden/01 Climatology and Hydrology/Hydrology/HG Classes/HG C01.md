# 📒Class Summary
Introduction to **Hydrology** — its main goals, challenges, and physical foundations.  
The class covered the **global hydrological cycle**, emphasizing how solar radiation and gravity drive water movement through different **reservoirs** (atmosphere, surface, soil, groundwater, oceans).  
We also discussed **residence times**, **energy–mass conservation**, and how the **ocean conveyor belt** links water, heat, and carbon transport at the planetary scale.

# 📝 Notes

## Introduction
_Hydrology_ is the scientific study of the *movement*, *distribution*, and *quality* of water on Earth. 
## Challenges
- Access to potable water
- Adequate sanitation
- Food security
- Flood Protection
- Water Resources Management
### Scope of Hydrology

Hydrology focuses on **quantifying the water cycle** at or near the Earth’s surface. 

Characteristics of hydrological processes:
- **Non-stationary** (change in time)
- **Interconnected** with other natural systems

Fundamental physical laws:

- **Conservation of mass**
- **Conservation of energy**

### Work Areas of Hydrology

- Measurement and analysis of hydrological processes
- Engineering tasks (design, infrastructure)
- Integrated water resources management
- Agriculture and food production
- Research

## The Global Hydrological Cycle

Driven mainly by:

- **Solar radiation**
- **Gravity**
- (Optionally Earth’s rotation)

Connected to the **planet’s heat balance** and to other **biogeochemical cycles** (carbon, nitrogen, etc.).  
Hydrological processes vary in **space** and **time**.

Spatial variation:

- Local & regional differences in climate, soil, vegetation.

Temporal variation:

- Seasonal & annual dynamics of precipitation, evaporation, runoff, etc.

## Global hydrological cycle

The Global hydrological cycle works as a **natural pollution control** due: 

- **Evaporation & distillation in the atmosphere**
- **Physical filtration** in soils and surface water
- **Chemical and biological transformations**

#### Water reservoirs: residence times
- **Atmosphere** – 9 days
- **Rivers/Lakes** – 0.3–80 years
- **Soils** – ~0.5 years
- **Groundwater** – 100 to 10,000 years
- **Glaciers/Ice caps** – ~10⁵ years
- **Oceans** – 3,200 years

###  Global ocean conveyer belt

- Large-scale circulation of ocean water
- Driven by differences in density (temperature & salinity)
- Full cycle duration: ~1,000 years
- Important for **nutrient** and **CO₂** transport

# 🐢 Definitions

- **Hydrology** – Scientific study of the movement, distribution and quality of water on Earth.
- **Hydrological Cycle** – Continuous circulation of water on Earth, driven by solar radiation and gravity.
- **Non-stationary** – A process that changes over time; not constant.
- **Water Resources Management** – Planning and controlling water use, distribution, protection and sustainability.
- **Conservation of Mass** – Mass cannot be created or destroyed in a closed system (basis for water balance).
- **Conservation of Energy** – Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
- **Residence Time** – Average time water stays in a reservoir (atmosphere, ocean, groundwater, etc.).
- **Global Conveyor Belt (Thermohaline Circulation)** – Global-scale ocean circulation driven by water density differences (temperature & salinity), redistributing heat, nutrients and CO₂.

# 💡 Key Takeaways

- Hydrology quantifies the **movement, storage, and transformation of water** across Earth's systems.
- The **hydrological cycle** is an **open, dynamic system**, exchanging both energy and matter with the atmosphere and lithosphere.
- **Solar energy** drives evaporation and atmospheric circulation, while **gravity** controls runoff and infiltration.
- **Residence time** determines how quickly water moves through each reservoir — from days in the atmosphere to millennia in groundwater and oceans.
- The **global conveyor belt** connects the hydrosphere and climate system by transporting **heat**, **CO₂**, and **nutrients** across ocean basins.
- Understanding **mass and energy conservation** underpins hydrological modeling and water resource management.

# 💭 Questions

1. **Conceptual:**
    - Why is hydrology considered a _non-stationary_ science?
    - How do solar radiation and gravity interact to drive the hydrological cycle?
2. **Applied:**
    - How would an increase in global temperature affect the residence time of atmospheric and oceanic water?
    - What could happen to the global conveyor belt if salinity in polar regions decreases?
3. **Analytical:**
    - How could conservation of mass be applied to compute a basin’s water balance?
    - Why is residence time important for understanding pollutant transport in groundwater?
