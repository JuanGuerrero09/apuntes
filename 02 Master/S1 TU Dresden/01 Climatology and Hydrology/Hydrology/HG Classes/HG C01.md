# 📒Class Summary
Introduction to **Hydrology** — its main goals, challenges, and physical foundations.  
The class covered the **global hydrological cycle**, emphasizing how solar radiation and gravity drive water movement through different **reservoirs** (atmosphere, surface, soil, groundwater, oceans).  
We also discussed **residence times**, **energy–mass conservation**, and how the **ocean conveyor belt** links water, heat, and carbon transport at the planetary scale.

# 📝 Notes

## Introduction

_Hydrology_ is the scientific study of the *movement*, *distribution*, and *quality* of water on Earth. 
### Scope of Hydrology

Hydrology focuses on **quantifying the water cycle** at or near the Earth’s surface. 

Characteristics of hydrological processes:
- **Non-stationary** (change in time)
- **Interconnected** with other natural systems

Fundamental physical laws:
- **Conservation of mass**
- **Conservation of energy**

### Work Areas of Hydrology

- Measurement and analysis of hydrological processes
- Engineering tasks (design, infrastructure)
- Integrated water resources management
- Agriculture and food production
- Research

## The Global Hydrological Cycle

Driven mainly by:

- **Solar radiation**
- **Gravity**
- (Optionally Earth’s rotation)

Connected to the **planet’s heat balance** and to other **biogeochemical cycles** (carbon, nitrogen, etc.).  
Hydrological processes vary in **space** and **time**.

Spatial variation:

- Local & regional differences in climate, soil, vegetation.

Temporal variation:

- Seasonal & annual dynamics of precipitation, evaporation, runoff, etc.

The Global hydrological cycle works as a **natural pollution control** due: 

- **Evaporation & distillation in the atmosphere**
- **Physical filtration** in soils and surface water
- **Chemical and biological transformations**

#### Water reservoirs: residence times
- **Atmosphere** – 9 days
- **Rivers/Lakes** – 0.3–80 years
- **Soils** – ~0.5 years
- **Groundwater** – 100 to 10,000 years
- **Glaciers/Ice caps** – ~10⁵ years
- **Oceans** – 3,200 years

###  Global ocean conveyer belt

- Large-scale circulation of ocean water
- Driven by differences in density (temperature & salinity)
- Full cycle duration: ~1,000 years
- Important for **nutrient** and **CO₂** transport

# 🐢 Definitions

- **Hydrology** – Scientific study of the movement, distribution and quality of water on Earth.
- **Hydrological Cycle** – Continuous circulation of water on Earth, driven by solar radiation and gravity.
- **Non-stationary** – A process that changes over time; not constant.
- **Water Resources Management** – Planning and controlling water use, distribution, protection and sustainability.
- **Conservation of Mass** – Mass cannot be created or destroyed in a closed system (basis for water balance).
- **Conservation of Energy** – Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
- **Residence Time** – Average time water stays in a reservoir (atmosphere, ocean, groundwater, etc.).
- **Global Conveyor Belt (Thermohaline Circulation)** – Global-scale ocean circulation driven by water density differences (temperature & salinity), redistributing heat, nutrients and CO₂.

# 💡 Key Takeaways

- Hydrology quantifies the **movement, storage, and transformation of water** across Earth's systems.
- The **hydrological cycle** is an **open, dynamic system**, exchanging both energy and matter with the atmosphere and lithosphere.
- **Solar energy** drives evaporation and atmospheric circulation, while **gravity** controls runoff and infiltration.
- **Residence time** determines how quickly water moves through each reservoir — from days in the atmosphere to millennia in groundwater and oceans.
- The **global conveyor belt** connects the hydrosphere and climate system by transporting **heat**, **CO₂**, and **nutrients** across ocean basins.
- Understanding **mass and energy conservation** underpins hydrological modeling and water resource management.

# 💭 Questions

1. **Conceptual:**
    - Why is hydrology considered a _non-stationary_ science?
	    r: Because the statistical properties of hydrological variables (like mean precipitation or peak discharge) change over time due to climate change or land-use changes, meaning the past is no longer a perfect predictor of the future.
    - How do solar radiation and gravity interact to drive the hydrological cycle?
	    r: The solar radiation provides the energy that allows the water to change state, from solid to liquid and from liquid to gas, while gravity allows the movement of the water, being this runoff, precipitation, groundwater movement, between others.
2. **Applied:**
    - How would an increase in global temperature affect the residence time of atmospheric and oceanic water?
	    r: Would accelerate the time between the different phases of the cycle, since it would drive more energy into it allowing the changes in state to move more quickly
    - What could happen to the global conveyor belt if salinity in polar regions decreases?
	    r: Lower salinity reduces water density in polar regions. This prevents the water from sinking, which can slow or 'shut down' the circulation, disrupting the global transport of heat, nutrients, and $CO_2$.
3. **Analytical:**
    - How could conservation of mass be applied to compute a basin’s water balance?
	    r: Using the water balance equation, since it would mean that the precipitation that the area receives has to be equal to the evapotranspiration and the runoff of the zone
    - Why is residence time important for understanding pollutant transport in groundwater?
	    r: Since groundwater residence time is very long (up to 10,000 years), a pollutant introduced today creates a long-term 'legacy' issue; the system cannot flush itself quickly, making remediation extremely difficult."

# 📅 Homework

Check water balance calculation

### Water Balance Ecuation

$$P - R - E - T - G = \Delta S$$
In simple terms, assuming the E and T as ET (Evapotranspiration), don't taking into account groundwater and assuming no change in the storage of the system

$$
P = ET + R
$$

The precipitation is equal to the evapotranspiration and the runoff in the system.

Also, for specific cases:

- **Short-term (Storm event):** $\Delta S$ is very high (soil saturates), and $ET$ is often negligible.
- **Annual scale:** $\Delta S$ is often assumed to be zero.
