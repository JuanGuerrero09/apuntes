# üìöNotes

# Part I: Hydrology

# 1. Introduction
_Hydrology_ is the scientific study of the *movement*, *distribution*, and *quality* of water on Earth. 
## Challenges
- Access to potable water
- Adequate sanitation
- Food security
- Flood Protection
- Water Resources Management
### Scope of Hydrology

Hydrology focuses on **quantifying the water cycle** at or near the Earth‚Äôs surface. 

Characteristics of hydrological processes:
- **Non-stationary** (change in time)
- **Interconnected** with other natural systems

Fundamental physical laws:

- **Conservation of mass**
- **Conservation of energy**

### Work Areas of Hydrology

- Measurement and analysis of hydrological processes
- Engineering tasks (design, infrastructure)
- Integrated water resources management
- Agriculture and food production
- Research

# 2. Hydrologic Cycle
## The Global Hydrological Cycle

Driven mainly by:

- **Solar radiation**
- **Gravity**
- (Optionally Earth‚Äôs rotation)

Connected to the **planet‚Äôs heat balance** and to other **biogeochemical cycles** (carbon, nitrogen, etc.).  
Hydrological processes vary in **space** and **time**.

Spatial variation:

- Local & regional differences in climate, soil, vegetation.

Temporal variation:

- Seasonal & annual dynamics of precipitation, evaporation, runoff, etc.

## Global hydrological cycle

The Global hydrological cycle works as a **natural pollution control** due: 

- **Evaporation & distillation in the atmosphere**
- **Physical filtration** in soils and surface water
- **Chemical and biological transformations**

![[Pasted image 20251021222605.png]]
#### Water reservoirs: residence times
- **Atmosphere** ‚Äì 9 days
- **Rivers/Lakes** ‚Äì 0.3‚Äì80 years
- **Soils** ‚Äì ~0.5 years
- **Groundwater** ‚Äì 100 to 10,000 years
- **Glaciers/Ice caps** ‚Äì ~10‚Åµ years
- **Oceans** ‚Äì 3,200 years

###  Global ocean conveyer belt

- Large-scale circulation of ocean water
- Driven by differences in density (temperature & salinity)
- Full cycle duration: ~1,000 years
- Important for **nutrient** and **CO‚ÇÇ** transport

# 3. Water Balance

## Water Balance Equation

### Conservation of Mass

Main components:

- **P** ‚Äì Precipitation
- **ETR** ‚Äì Evapotranspiration
- **R** ‚Äì Runoff
- **ŒîS** ‚Äì Change in storage

General form:
$$\Delta S = P - ETR - R$$
To compare catchments, water balance is expressed in **mm** over a defined **area** (catchment) and **time period** (e.g. hydrological year).

### Different Spatial and Temporal Scales

- **Global annual average:**
    $P = ETR \quad (953 \, \text{mm/yr})$
- **Land surface (149 million km¬≤):**
    $P = ETR + R = 758 = 490 + 268 \, \text{mm/yr}$

### Storage Components

Water can be stored in:
- Snow / ice
- Soil moisture
- Groundwater
- Surface water (lakes, rivers)

---

### Temporal Variation of Components

![[Pasted image 20251021224900.png]]

Phases:

- **Water surplus**
- **Water deficit** (soil & groundwater depletion)
- **Subsurface recharge**

Hydrological year in Central Europe: **1.11 ‚Äì 31.10**

---

### Factors Influencing Local Water Balance

- Climate (precipitation, temperature)
- Morphology (slope, elevation)
- Geology (permeability)
- Vegetation
- Soil characteristics

Variation of ETR and runoff depending on infiltration capacity:

- **Low infiltration capacity ‚Üí high surface runoff, low ETR**
- **High infiltration capacity ‚Üí high groundwater recharge, lower runoff**

---

### Generalized Water Balance for Any Land Area

$$P = ETR + \Delta S + SW_{out} - SW_{in} + GW_{out} - GW_{in}$$

Where:

- **SW** = Surface Water
- **GW** = Groundwater
- **in/out** = inflow or outflow

---

## Water and Heat Balance

Connection through **latent heat of vaporization (Œª)**.

Energy balance:
$$R_n = G + H + LE \quad [W/m^2]$$
Where:

- **Rn** ‚Äì Net radiation
- **G** ‚Äì Ground heat flux
- **H** ‚Äì Sensible heat flux
- **LE** ‚Äì Latent heat flux = Œª¬∑E
- $\lambda \approx 2448 \, \text{kJ/m}^2$ to vaporize 1 mm of water
