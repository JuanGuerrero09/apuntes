## Water Balance Equation

### Conservation of Mass

Main components:

- **P** – Precipitation
- **ETR** – Evapotranspiration
- **R** – Runoff
- **ΔS** – Change in storage

General form:
$$\Delta S = P - ETR - R$$
To compare catchments, water balance is expressed in **mm** over a defined **area** (catchment) and **time period** (e.g. hydrological year).

### Different Spatial and Temporal Scales

- **Global annual average:**
    $P = ETR \quad (953 \, \text{mm/yr})$
- **Land surface (149 million km²):**
    $P = ETR + R = 758 = 490 + 268 \, \text{mm/yr}$

### Storage Components

Water can be stored in:
- Snow / ice
- Soil moisture
- Groundwater
- Surface water (lakes, rivers)

### Temporal Variation of Components

Phases:

- **Water surplus**
- **Water deficit** (soil & groundwater depletion)
- **Subsurface recharge**

Hydrological year in Central Europe: **1.11 – 31.10**

---

### Factors Influencing Local Water Balance

- Climate (precipitation, temperature)
- Morphology (slope, elevation)
- Geology (permeability)
- Vegetation
- Soil characteristics

Variation of ETR and runoff depending on infiltration capacity:

- **Low infiltration capacity → high surface runoff, low ETR**
- **High infiltration capacity → high groundwater recharge, lower runoff**

---

### Generalized Water Balance for Any Land Area

$$P = ETR + \Delta S + SW_{out} - SW_{in} + GW_{out} - GW_{in}$$

Where:

- **SW** = Surface Water
- **GW** = Groundwater
- **in/out** = inflow or outflow

## Water and Heat Balance

Connection through **latent heat of vaporization (λ)**.

Energy balance:
$$R_n = G + H + LE \quad [W/m^2]$$
Where:

- **Rn** – Net radiation
- **G** – Ground heat flux
- **H** – Sensible heat flux
- **LE** – Latent heat flux = λ·E
- $\lambda \approx 2448 \, \text{kJ/m}^2$ to vaporize 1 mm of water

# 🐢 Definitions

- **Water Balance Equation** – Relationship between precipitation (P), evapotranspiration (ETR), runoff (R), and change in storage (ΔS):
$$\Delta S = P - ETR - R$$
- **Evapotranspiration (ETR)** – Combined process of evaporation (from water/soil) and transpiration (from plants).
- **Runoff (R)** – Water that flows on the surface (surface runoff) or underground (baseflow) out of a catchment.
- **Storage (S)** – Water stored as snow, ice, soil moisture, groundwater, lakes, etc.
- **Hydrological Year** – Time frame for hydrological measurements. In Central Europe: **1 November – 31 October**.
- **Latent Heat of Vaporization (λ)** – Energy needed to convert 1 mm of water into vapor (~2448 kJ/m²).
- **Net Radiation (Rn)** – Balance between incoming and outgoing radiation at the Earth’s surface.
- **Ground Heat Flux (G)** – Heat flow into the ground.
- **Sensible Heat Flux (H)** – Heat transferred by air movement and temperature gradients.
- **Latent Heat Flux (LE)** – Energy used for evaporation:
$$LE = \lambda \cdot E$$
