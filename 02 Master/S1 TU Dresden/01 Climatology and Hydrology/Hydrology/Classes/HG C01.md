# üìù Notes

## Introduction
_Hydrology_ is the scientific study of the *movement*, *distribution*, and *quality* of water on Earth. 
## Challenges
- Access to potable water
- Adequate sanitation
- Food security
- Flood Protection
- Water Resources Management
### Scope of Hydrology

Hydrology focuses on **quantifying the water cycle** at or near the Earth‚Äôs surface. 

Characteristics of hydrological processes:
- **Non-stationary** (change in time)
- **Interconnected** with other natural systems

Fundamental physical laws:

- **Conservation of mass**
- **Conservation of energy**

### Work Areas of Hydrology

- Measurement and analysis of hydrological processes
- Engineering tasks (design, infrastructure)
- Integrated water resources management
- Agriculture and food production
- Research

## The Global Hydrological Cycle

Driven mainly by:

- **Solar radiation**
- **Gravity**
- (Optionally Earth‚Äôs rotation)

Connected to the **planet‚Äôs heat balance** and to other **biogeochemical cycles** (carbon, nitrogen, etc.).  
Hydrological processes vary in **space** and **time**.

Spatial variation:

- Local & regional differences in climate, soil, vegetation.

Temporal variation:

- Seasonal & annual dynamics of precipitation, evaporation, runoff, etc.

## Global hydrological cycle

The Global hydrological cycle works as a **natural pollution control** due: 

- **Evaporation & distillation in the atmosphere**
- **Physical filtration** in soils and surface water
- **Chemical and biological transformations**

#### Water reservoirs: residence times
- **Atmosphere** ‚Äì 9 days
- **Rivers/Lakes** ‚Äì 0.3‚Äì80 years
- **Soils** ‚Äì ~0.5 years
- **Groundwater** ‚Äì 100 to 10,000 years
- **Glaciers/Ice caps** ‚Äì ~10‚Åµ years
- **Oceans** ‚Äì 3,200 years

###  Global ocean conveyer belt

- Large-scale circulation of ocean water
- Driven by differences in density (temperature & salinity)
- Full cycle duration: ~1,000 years
- Important for **nutrient** and **CO‚ÇÇ** transport

# üê¢ Definitions

- **Hydrology** ‚Äì Scientific study of the movement, distribution and quality of water on Earth.
- **Hydrological Cycle** ‚Äì Continuous circulation of water on Earth, driven by solar radiation and gravity.
- **Non-stationary** ‚Äì A process that changes over time; not constant.
- **Water Resources Management** ‚Äì Planning and controlling water use, distribution, protection and sustainability.
- **Conservation of Mass** ‚Äì Mass cannot be created or destroyed in a closed system (basis for water balance).
- **Conservation of Energy** ‚Äì Energy cannot be created or destroyed, only transformed.
- **Residence Time** ‚Äì Average time water stays in a reservoir (atmosphere, ocean, groundwater, etc.).
- **Global Conveyor Belt (Thermohaline Circulation)** ‚Äì Global-scale ocean circulation driven by water density differences (temperature & salinity), redistributing heat, nutrients and CO‚ÇÇ.
