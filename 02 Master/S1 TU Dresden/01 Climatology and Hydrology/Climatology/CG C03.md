# 📒Class Summary

This class introduces the fundamental concepts of **turbulence**, **turbulent fluxes**, and **atmospheric boundary-layer processes**. It explains how turbulent motions arise, how they transport momentum, heat, and moisture, and how these fluxes behave in the **surface layer** and the **outer boundary layer**. Atmospheric stability, lapse rates, wind profiles, and energy partitioning (Bowen ratio) are also discussed, alongside the analogy between scalar turbulent transport and Ohm’s law.

## Turbulence
### Characteristics of Turbulent Flow

Turbulent flow requires:

- **Motion** (most important): turbulence cannot exist without movement.
    
- **Irregularity**: fluctuations occur randomly in space and time.
    
- **Mixing efficiency**: turbulence enhances mixing of momentum, heat, and mass.
    
- **Vorticity / Rotation**: presence of swirling, 3D vortical structures.
    
- **Dissipation**: without constant energy input, turbulence decays as kinetic energy dissipates into heat via viscous forces at very small scales.

Internal motion can be generated by (surface) friction (forced, mechanical / shear driven turbulence) or convection (free convective turbulence)

- AT Reynolds avobe 5000 the flow becomes turbulent

$$
Re = \frac{uL}{v} = \frac{\text{intertial forces}}{\text{viscous forces}}
$$

- Viscous forces dominant -> Laminar flow
- Inertial forces dominant -> Turbulent flos


### Fluxes in the surface layer

**Roughness sublayer**
• No consistent theory on depth, roughly 2 times canopy (buildings) height
• Within the roughness sublayer, single roughness elements affect the flow
**Turbulent surface layer**
• Depth: lowest ~10% of the atmospheric boundary
layer
• Convection instead of conduction
	- molecular diffusivities have to be replaced by turbulent diffusivities (see flux equations for laminar boundary layer)
• Without horizontal transport, fluxes are constant
in the constant flux layer:
diffusivity increases, bout gradients decrease with
height  results in constant flux
• Within the surface layer, turbulent structures are
isotropic

Fluxes in the surface layer
• sensible heat flux:
$$H = \rho c_pp K_a \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}$$
• water vapour flux:
$$\lambda E  = K_v \frac{\partial \rho_v}{\partial z}$$
• momentum flux:
$$\tau =  \rho K_m \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}$$
• Any other flux (e.g., 𝑥 = CO2):

$$
F_x = K_x \frac{\partial \rho_x}{\partial z}
$$

### Fluxes in the outer layer

• Outer layer
• Upper ~90% of atmospheric boundary layer
• Vertical extent varies strongly
	up to > 2 km during the day (clear sky)
	<100 m during the night (clear sky)
• Mixing dominates
• Gradients disappear
• Mixed layer (mixing length h*)

## Atmospheric Stability ??
- In the surface layer (vertically oriented)
- Depends on:
	- ELR: *Environmental lapse rate* vertical temperature distribution
	- ALR: _Adiabatic lapse rate_ temperature a curve a parcel would follow if it were raised or lowered adiabatically (no heat aedded or substracted)
		- dry rate: 0.98 $Km^{-1}$
		- moist rate: 0.4 $Km^{-1}$ to 0.9 $Km^{-1}$
### Momentum flux and wind

Friction determines the wind profile in the boundary layer
- Influenced by:
	- Surface roughness
	- Atmospheric Stability
- Under netutral conditions: logarithmic wind profile
	- Neutral stratification ocurrs under closudu contidtions, strong winds and lower..

$z_0$ aerodymnamic roughness length


### Sensible hear flux and air temperature

Needs to be corrected for the effects of vertical atmospheric pressure changes by considering ALR
$$
H = \rho c_pK_a (\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}- ALR)
$$
other optiosn: replace termaprature T with potential termperature $\theta$

$$
H = \rho c_pK_a (\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z})
$$
Only for large dz above 2m



### Water vapor and latent heat fluxes

Exchagne between wet surface and atmosphere depens on vapor pressure deficit (VPD)
$$VPD = E - e$$
E stauration water vapor pressure
e water vapor pressure

Water content typically dcreases with height
At night dewfall can happend due to radiative cooling (inversion, downward flux)


### Sensible and latent heat fluxes
==$\beta$ bowen ratio==
- partitioning of available energy intio sensible H and latent heat $\lambda E$ fluxes
$$\beta = \frac{H}{\lambda E}$$Depens on availability of.....


### Remarks on convective exchange
- Flux gradient relationships are universal
	- Can be applies eg CO2, O3, polllen
	- Requirements: inert (no chem reaction) and light weight (gravity influence negligble) -> passive escalar
- - similarity to ohm law
I = V/R = 1/R * V 
Fx = Kx drhox/dz
