# 📒Class Summary

The lecture focused on the **surface energy and water balances of vegetated surfaces**, specifically contrasting **crops/grasslands** with **forests**. Key topics included the physiological control of transpiration via **stomatal resistance ($r_c$)**, the structural impact of canopy architecture on microclimates (momentum sinks and displacement height), and the phenomenon of **counter-gradient fluxes** (gusts vs. buoyancy).

Surface Energy and Water Balances

### Vegetated Surfaces (General)

Vegetated surfaces introduce complexity to the Energy Balance through biological and structural mechanisms.

**Water Balance Components:**

- **Transpiration:** Water released into the atmosphere through the **stomata** (see slide 28).
- **Interception Storage:** Temporary water storage on plant surfaces, primarily leaves.
- **Stem Flow:** Water that runs down the plant stems to the ground.
- **Throughfall:** Water that reaches the ground directly without being intercepted by the canopy.

**Key Characteristics:**

- **Volume Storage:** Energy and water are stored within the **soil-plant-air volume**.
- **Metabolism:** Photosynthesis (carbon uptake) and respiration (carbon release) affect energy and mass balances.
- **Biological Control:** Systematically higher plants control latent heat and water transport.
- **Momentum Sink:** The canopy structure absorbs wind energy, shifting the active surface.

**Measurement Challenges:** In grasslands and crops, measuring storage changes within the canopy and air is difficult; therefore, **Ground Heat Flux ($Q_G$)** is typically the primary measured subsurface component.

#### Stomatal Resistance ($r_c$) and Water Stress

- **Function:** $r_c$ represents the resistance plants offer to water vapor transport.
- **Water Stress:** As soil moisture nears the **wilting point**, the plant's capacity to extract water is reduced.
- **Response:** Under water stress, $r_c$ increases, leading to **reduced transpiration**. This results in reduced evaporative cooling and significantly **higher leaf temperatures**.

#### Effects on Climate: Above vs. Within Canopy

- **Above Canopy:** Profiles are similar to bare soil but shifted to an elevated active surface (Zero plane displacement height, $d$). Characteristics include higher wind speeds, higher temperatures, and lower $\text{CO}_2$ concentrations due to plant uptake.
- **Within Canopy:** Profiles are altered by the **momentum sink** and the fact that maximum radiation absorption occurs in the upper canopy, causing shading at the ground surface.

#### Specifics of Forest Canopies

Forests differ from crops due to their immense biomass and complex architecture.

- **Differences from Crops:**
    - **Architecture:** Divided into **crown space** and **stem space**.
    - **Albedo:** Forests have a smaller albedo than other vegetation because of **radiation trapping** (shadowing within the deep canopy).
    - **Roughness:** Larger biomass and height lead to a larger **roughness length ($z_0$)**.
    
- **Energy Balance:**
    - Low albedo leads to low $K\uparrow$.
    - Large leaf area facilitates large evapotranspiration ($ET$), keeping surface temperatures low and reducing $L\uparrow$.
    - **Net Radiation ($Q^*$):** Is typically higher (closer to $K\downarrow$) than in other vegetation types.

- **Climate & Water Balance:**    
    - **Interception:** A massive factor. Forest canopies can intercept 0.5–2 mm of rain or 2–6 mm of snow.
    - **Temperature Dynamics:** During the day, the temperature maximum is reached within the canopy; at night, the minimum is also in the canopy, eventually sinking to the ground with a delay.
    - **Counter-gradient Fluxes:**
        - **Gusts (Sweeps):** Transport air downwards into the canopy.
        - **Buoyancy (Ejections/Bursts):** Upward movement of air bodies out of the canopy.

# 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Vegetation acts as a regulator:** Through stomatal resistance ($r_c$), plants actively influence evapotranspiration and their own temperature.
- **Forest Architecture matters:** The division between crown and stem space creates unique microclimates and massive interception capacities compared to shorter crops.
- **Radiation Trapping:** The deep structure of forests effectively "traps" sunlight, resulting in a lower albedo than grassland.
- **Identifying Land Cover:** Negative $\text{CO}_2$ fluxes indicate active vegetation; a large $Q_G$ and high radiation reaching the surface suggest a less dense canopy, ruling out a dense forest.

# 💭 Questions

- **Why is $Q^*$ in a forest closer to $K\downarrow$ compared to a sandy desert?**
The forest has a **much lower albedo** due to radiation trapping, so less $K\uparrow$ is lost. Second, forests are efficient evaporators ($ET$); this keeps the canopy cool, which **reduces the longwave loss ($L\uparrow$)**. In a desert, the surface gets extremely hot, losing a massive amount of energy through $L\uparrow$, which further reduces the net radiation $Q^*$.
- **What physically causes the temperature stratification inside a forest to be opposite to the atmosphere above it at night?**
This is caused by the **location of the radiative surface**. At night, the "active surface" is the **top of the canopy (crown space)**, which loses longwave radiation to the sky and cools rapidly. The air _inside_ the forest (stem space) is sheltered by the biomass above it, which acts as an insulating blanket, trapping warmer air near the ground. This creates a temperature inversion at the canopy top, while the air below remains relatively warmer for longer.

# 🐢 Definitions

- **Stomatal Resistance ($r_c$):** The physiological resistance exerted by plant pores to regulate water vapor and $\text{CO}_2$ exchange.
- **Interception:** The process where precipitation is caught by the canopy and evaporated before reaching the soil.
- **Gust (Sweep):** Downward transport of high-momentum air into the canopy.
- **Buoyancy (Ejection):** Upward transport of low-momentum air out of the canopy.
- **Zero Plane Displacement Height ($d$):** The effective height of the momentum sink in a canopy.

# 📅 Homework

- **Exercise Review:** Interpret the differences between the three days of flux data provided in the slides (mostly clear sky days).
- **Identification:** Use the provided CO2 and energy flux graphs to verify why the site (Graswang/Fendt) is likely grassland and not a dense forest.
- **Physics check:** Review the meanings and typical magnitudes for $Q_H$, $Q_E$, $Q^*$, and $Q_G$ in different environments.
