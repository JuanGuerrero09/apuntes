# 📒Class Summary

This lecture explores the **physical mechanics of the Atmospheric Boundary Layer (ABL)**. We move from the theoretical Navier–Stokes equations to the practical application of how turbulence moves heat, water, and momentum. Key focus: how atmospheric stability (ELR vs. ALR) dictates the vertical structure of our climate.

## Physical basics of boundary layer meteorology

### Turbulence: The Engine of the ABL

Turbulence is the primary mechanism for vertical transport. Without it, the "Free Atmosphere" would be almost entirely disconnected from surface conditions.
#### Characteristics of Turbulent Flow

Turbulence is a complex, chaotic flow regime that emerges when inertial forces dominate over viscous forces.

Key characteristics:

- **Motion** (most important): turbulence cannot exist without movement.
- **Irregularity**: fluctuations occur randomly in space and time.
- **Mixing efficiency**: turbulence enhances mixing of momentum, heat, and mass.
- **Vorticity / Rotation**: presence of swirling, 3D vortical structures.
- **Dissipation**: without constant energy input, turbulence decays as kinetic energy dissipates into heat via viscous forces at very small scales.

Turbulence can be generated by:

- **Forced/mechanical turbulence:** produced by shear (e.g., wind blowing over a rough surface).
- **Convective turbulence:** produced by buoyancy (e.g., warm surface heating the air).

**Transition to turbulence:**  
Flow becomes turbulent typically when:

$$
Re = \frac{\text{intertial forces}}{\text{viscous forces}} =\frac{uL}{v} \geq 5000 
$$

Where:

- $u$ = characteristic velocity
- $L$ = characteristic length
- $\nu$ = kinematic viscosity

Interpretation:

- Low $Re$ → viscous forces dominate → laminar
- High $Re$ → inertial forces dominate → turbulence

### Fluxes in the surface layer

The surface layer forms the lower ∼10% of the atmospheric boundary layer.
#### Roughness Sublayer

- Depth ≈ 2× canopy/building height.
- Individual roughness elements (trees, buildings) influence local flow.
- No universal theory exists for its exact depth.

**Turbulent surface layer**
- Depth: lowest ~10% of the atmospheric boundary layer
- Convection instead of conduction
	- molecular diffusivities have to be replaced by turbulent diffusivities (see flux equations for laminar boundary layer)
- Molecular diffusion is negligible → replaced by **turbulent diffusivities** ($K_x$).
- Because turbulent fluxes become height-independent:
- Without horizontal transport, **fluxes are constant** in the constant flux layer:
	diffusivity increases, bout gradients decrease with height $\rightarrow$ results in constant flux
- Within the surface layer, turbulent structures are isotropic

### Turbulent Flux Equations

In the surface layer, the vertical turbulent flux of any quantity is expressed using **turbulent diffusivity**:

#### Sensible Heat Flux
$$H = - \rho\, c_p\,  K_a \frac{\partial T}{\partial z}$$
#### Latent Heat Flux (water vapour flux):
$$\lambda E  = - K_v \frac{\partial \rho_v}{\partial z}$$
#### Shear Stress

$$\tau = - \rho K_m \frac{\partial u}{\partial z}$$
#### Scalar Flux (general form)

For any scalar $x$:

$$
F_x = - K_x \frac{\partial \rho_x}{\partial z}
$$


#### Meaning of Each Term (Expanded)

- $\rho$ – air density $(\text{kg m}^{-3})$
- $c_p$ – specific heat at constant pressure $(1006\ \text{J kg}^{-1}\text{K}^{-1})$
- $K_a$ – turbulent thermal diffusivity $(\text{m}^2 \text{s}^{-1})$
- $T$ – air temperature
- $\lambda E$ – latent heat flux $(\text{W m}^{-2})$
- $K_v$ – turbulent diffusivity of water vapor
- $\rho_v$ – water vapor density
- $\tau$ – momentum flux (shear stress)
- $K_m$ – turbulent momentum diffusivity
- $u$ – horizontal wind speed
- $K_x$ – turbulent diffusivity for scalar $x$

#### About “turbulent diffusivity” $K_x$

Turbulent diffusivity describes how effective turbulence is in transporting mass, energy, or momentum.  
It replaces molecular diffusion in turbulent flows and is **several orders of magnitude larger**.

#### Turbulent surface layer (continued) 

• Without horizontal transport, fluxes are constant in the constant flux layer: 
	diffusivity increases, bout gradients decrease with height → results in constant flux
• Within the surface layer, turbulent structures are isotropic
#### Isotropy

Small-scale turbulence (Kolmogorov scales) is **independent of direction**, allowing the use of common $K_x$ approximations.

### Fluxes in the Outer Layer

- Represents the **upper 90%** of the atmospheric boundary layer.
- Strong dependence on atmospheric conditions:
    - > 2 km deep during daytime with clear skies
    - <100 m during stable, clear-sky nights

In the outer layer:
- **Turbulent mixing dominates**.
- Vertical gradients of temperature, humidity, momentum nearly vanish.
- Produces a **mixed layer** with uniform - properties.

### Atmospheric Stability

Atmospheric stability determines the **response of air parcels to vertical displacement**.

### Key Concepts

#### Environmental Lapse Rate (ELR)
$$ELR = -\frac{\partial T_{\mathrm{env}}}{\partial z}$$
Actual observed temperature decrease with height.

#### Adiabatic Lapse Rates (ALR)

Parcel temperature change when moved adiabatically:

- **Dry ALR (DALR):**
$$DALR = 9.8\ \text{K km}^{-1}$$
- **Moist ALR (MALR):**
$$MALR \approx 4 - 9\ \text{K km}^{-1}$$
Moist air cools more slowly due to latent heat release.

#### Determining Stability
$$\text{Compare } ELR \text{ to } ALR$$
- **Stable:** $ELR < ALR$  
	parcel becomes colder and denser → sinks back
- **Neutral:** $ELR = ALR$  
    parcel neither rises nor sinks
- **Unstable:** $ELR > ALR$  
    parcel becomes warmer and lighter → continues rising → convection

### Potential Temperature $\theta$

Used to remove compression/expansion effects:
$$\theta = T \left(\frac{p_0}{p}\right)^{R/c_p}$$
Stability criterion:

- $\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z} > 0$ → stable
- $= 0$ → neutral
- $< 0$ → unstable

### Momentum flux and wind

Wind profile is shaped by:

- surface roughness
- atmospheric stability
#### Neutral Conditions → Logarithmic Wind Profile

$$u(z) = \frac{u_*}{\kappa} \ln\left(\frac{z}{z_0}\right)$$
where:

- $u_*$ = friction velocity
- $\kappa$ = von Kármán constant
- $z_0$ = aerodynamic roughness length

Roughness lengths vary by surface type:

### Sensible Heat Flux and Air Temperature Profiles

Needs to be corrected for the effects of vertical atmospheric pressure changes by considering ALR.
$$
H = - \rho c_pK_a (\frac{\partial T}{\partial z}- ALR)
$$
Or potential temperature

$$
H = - \rho c_pK_a (\frac{\partial \theta}{\partial z})
$$
### Interpretation

- **Positive $H$** → heat transferred upward (daytime)
- **Negative $H$** → heat transferred downward (nighttime)

Vertical temperature profiles evolve with diurnal cycle and atmospheric heating/cooling.

---
### Water vapor and latent heat fluxes

Exchange between wet surface and atmosphere driven by **vapor pressure deficit (VPD)**:
$$VPD = E - e$$
- $E$: saturation vapor pressure
- $e$: actual vapor pressure

Water vapor typically decreases with height.  
Nighttime radiative cooling may generate **dewfall**.

---

### Bowen Ratio
$$\beta = \frac{H}{\lambda E}$$Represents partitioning of available energy:

- $\beta > 1$: sensible heat dominates (dry surfaces)
- $\beta < 1$: latent heat dominates (wet surfaces)


### Remarks on convective exchange
Flux–gradient similarity applies to any passive scalar such as **CO₂, O₃, pollen**, provided:

- scalar is inert (no chemical reactions)
- gravitational settling is negligible

Analogy with Ohm’s law:

- voltage ↔ concentration gradient
- current ↔ scalar flux
- resistance ↔ inverse of diffusivity

### Outer-Layer Structure (Day vs Night)

#### Daytime

- Maximum boundary-layer height
- Strong mixing homogenizes T, humidity, wind
- Sharp capping inversion at top

#### Nighttime

- Strong surface cooling → temperature inversion
- Weak, shallow mechanical turbulence
- Suppressed vertical mixing

# 💭 Questions

- What influences the friction to determine the wind profile in the boundary layer?
The **Roughness Length ($z_0$)** and **Atmospheric Stability** are the two primary factors.

- In what depends the Atmospheric stability?
Stability depends on the **Vertical Temperature Gradient** (ELR vs ALR). Turbulence is a _result_ of stability (convective) or wind speed (mechanical).

- At what time does the boundary layer reach it's maximum height
Occurs in the **late afternoon** (around 4–5 PM), not exactly at midday. Even though solar radiation peaks at noon, the ground continues to heat the air for several hours after, allowing the boundary layer to keep growing.

- How does atmospheric stability modify the shape of the wind profile?
In **stable conditions**, the wind profile is **stretched and steep** because vertical mixing is suppressed. In **unstable conditions**, the profile is **more uniform (vertical)** because strong turbulence effectively mixes fast-moving air from higher up down to the surface.

- Why is turbulent diffusivity far more effective than molecular diffusivity?
Because is several orders of magnitude higher than molecular diffusivity

- Under what conditions is the flux–gradient relationship $F_x = -K_x \partial_x / \partial z$ invalid?
It fails in the **Roughness Sublayer** (very close to buildings/trees where flow is too complex) and during **Counter-gradient flow** (where large eddies move heat from cold to warm areas, which happens sometimes in very convective conditions).

- Why does the moist adiabatic lapse rate vary between 0.4 and 0.9 K/(100 m)?
It depends on **Temperature**. Warmer air holds more water vapor; when it condenses, it releases **more latent heat**, which offsets the cooling more significantly, resulting in a smaller lapse rate ($0.4\text{ K}/100\text{ m}$).

- How do roughness elements influence mechanical turbulence generation?
Generate friction to the wind

- What meteorological conditions lead to strong nocturnal inversions?
Strong surface cooling

- What are the key characteristics of turbulence (name 3)?
Motion, irregularity, dissipation.
