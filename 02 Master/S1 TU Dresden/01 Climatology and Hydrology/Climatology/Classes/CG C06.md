# 📒 Class Summary

The lecture explored the **specifics of near-surface turbulence** and how different land-cover types (bare soil, sandy deserts, snow/ice, water, and vegetation) influence the local climate. The discussion centered on how physical properties like albedo, transparency, and biological mechanisms (stomata) modify the **Surface Energy Balance (SEB)** and the structure of the atmospheric boundary layer.

### Bare soil

The energy balance is idealized in this kind of site, so it was already studied

### Non-vegetated surfaces

#### Sandy desert:

Typically located on the equator with no water availability and typically high albedo.

**Effects on energy balance**:

- High solar radiation input (80% of $S_0$).
- Still normal $Q^*$ due to high albedo (0.2 - 0.45) causing high $K\uparrow$, and strong surface heating causing high $L\uparrow$.
- **No $Q_e$** due to lack of water.
- **Morning**: $Q_G$ dominates as the surface heats up.
- **Afternoon**: Strong atmospheric temperature gradients result in a **strongly unstable atmospheric boundary layer** and strong $Q_H$.
- **Inefficiency**: Energy transport in sand is inefficient; no temperature change is observed 30 cm below the surface.
- **Extremes**: Surface temperatures range from 28°C to 65°C, creating strongly convective conditions and high wind velocities.

#### Snow and Ice:
Transparent to radiation and functions as a multi-phase system. High but variable albedo.

- **Effects on energy balance**:
    
    - **Transparency**: Radiation is absorbed in a **volume** rather than a thin surface layer. Following **Beer's Law**, $K\downarrow$ reaches depths of 1m (snow) to 10m (ice).
    
    - **Albedo**: Very high (0.2 - 0.95), meaning most $K\downarrow$ is reflected, resulting in a small $Q^*$. Albedo varies with snow age, dust, and solar angle.
    
    - **Volume Consideration**: No $Q_G$ at the lower end; instead, the change in energy stored in the volume ($\Delta Q_s$) is considered.
    
    - **Phase Changes**: In a wet pack (melting/freezing), the energy consumed/released by melting ice or freezing water (**$\Delta Q_M$**) must be considered.

	- **Water balance**: Must include runoff (**$\Delta r$**).
    
	- **Examples**:
	    - _Melting snow_: As $T$ reaches 0°C, $\Delta Q_M$ rises and $Q_e$ increases as liquid water becomes available.
	    - _Melting glacier_: Dust reduces albedo, increasing $Q^*$. Energy is consumed by melting, and water is transported away as runoff ($\Delta r$) rather than $Q_e$.
    
    - **Diurnal Dynamics**:
        - **Daytime**: Absorption across a volume leads to very little surface temperature increase; results in a stable to neutral boundary layer. Temperature maximum is located **beneath** the surface.
        - **Nighttime**: $L\uparrow$ is released only at the surface. Snow acts as an insulating cover for the ground due to low conductivity.

#### Water
Characterized by convection and advection below the surface and high transparency.

**Effects on energy balance**:

- **Absorption (Beer's Law)**: $K\downarrow$ penetrates up to 10m. Penetration depth depends on wind speed and radiation absorbing substances/particles.
    
- **Varying Albedo**: Total reflection (high albedo) occurs in early morning/late afternoon on sunny days. Waves can modify this. Overcast days show small, constant albedo.
    
- **Thermal Stability**: Surface temperature ($L\uparrow$) remains almost constant due to deep absorption and efficient **convection** within the water body.
    
- **Energy Partitioning**: High water availability means **$Q_e$ consumes ~90% of $Q^*$** annually. This leads to low $Q_H$ and a very low **Bowen ratio (~0.1)**.
    
- **Storage and Advection**: The heat storage change (**$\Delta Q_s$**) is positive (sink) during the day and negative (source) at night. Crucially, **water currents cause horizontal advection ($\Delta Q_A$)**, which must be factored into the balance.

**Shallow Water**: $K\downarrow$ reaches the soil beneath the water, heating both the water body and the underlying soil. Ground heat flux (**$Q_G$**) must be considered.

**Conservative Climate**: Reasons for little thermal response include deep penetration of radiation, efficient mixing (liquid convection), evaporation as a latent sink, and a **large thermal capacity** (3x that of most soils).

**Atmospheric Climate (Tropical Ocean)**: Little variation with height near the surface. The mixed layer is capped by the **"trade wind inversion"**, which allows for cloud formation but prevents precipitation over the oceans.

### Vegetated surfaces

**New characteristics**:

- Energy and water storage within the **soil-plant-air volume**.
- Metabolic processes: **Photosynthesis** (energy/carbon uptake) and **Respiration** (release).
- Biological control of latent heat via higher plants.
- Canopy acts as a momentum sink.

#### Energy and water storage in soil-plant-air volume:

- Storage terms: $\Delta Q_S$ (physical heat), $\Delta Q_P$ (biochemical energy from photosynthesis), and $\Delta Q_A$ (advection).

- If the considered soil layer is deep enough, $Q_G$ to deeper layers becomes negligible.

- Water balance: Includes runoff ($\Delta r$), storage in the air volume, and storage on plants ($\Delta S$).

#### Photosynthesis and respiration:

- **Photosynthesis (P)**: Daytime only, requires PAR (Photosynthetically Active Radiation).
- **Respiration (R)**: Continuous process.
- **NPP (Net Primary Production)** = $P - R$.
- **Carbon Balance**: Daytime is photosynthesis dominant (carbon uptake / positive NPP); nighttime is respiration dominant (carbon release / negative NPP).

#### Control of latent heat by plants:

- Gas and water vapor exchange occur through **stomata**.
- Plants actively influence their climate: stomata close during **water stress** or drought to minimize loss, increasing resistances of water vapor and $CO_2$ exchange.

#### Momentum sink within the canopy:

- **Active Surface Concept**: The exchange surface is lifted to the **zero plane displacement height ($d$)** where wind velocity is estimated zero.

- **Rules of Thumb**:
    - $d \approx 2/3 h$
    - $z_0 \approx 1/10 h$ (roughness length)
    - (Where $h$ is canopy height (10 % tallest vegetation)).
- **Wind Profile**: $u(z) = \frac{u_*}{k} \ln\left(\frac{z - d}{z_0}\right)$ where $z$ is height.

• Effect on momentum exchange (and others) needs to be considered: 
$u(z) - u(z_0)$

being z = variable of heigh
#### Radiation balance:

- Primarily exchanged at the canopy surface (multi-layer system).
- Penetration follows **Beer's Law** and depends on stand architecture.
- **Albedo**: Decreases as stand height increases due to **radiation trapping** and mutual shadowing. Albedo is highest when the sun is low, but has little effect on the total budget.

# 💡 Key Takeaways

- **Surface Heterogeneity:** Each land-cover type (desert, ice, water, vegetation) creates a unique microclimate by partitioning the **Surface Energy Balance (SEB)** differently based on its physical and biological properties.
    
- **Volume vs. Surface Balance:** Transparent media like **snow, ice, and water** distribute energy through a volume (following **Beer's Law**) rather than a single surface layer, which prevents extreme surface temperature spikes during the day.
    
- **The Bowen Ratio ($\beta$) as a Diagnostic Tool:** It serves as a primary indicator of surface type; $\beta$ is extremely low over water (~0.1) due to dominant latent heat ($Q_e$) and extremely high in deserts where sensible heat ($Q_H$) dominates.
    
- **Biological Regulation:** Vegetated surfaces are not passive; they actively control water loss and energy exchange through **stomatal resistance**, effectively "tuning" their own local climate.
    
- **Aerodynamic Coupling:** Dense vegetation lifts the effective level of momentum, heat, and mass exchange to the **displacement height ($d$)**, making the canopy structure a critical parameter for atmospheric modeling.
    
- **Thermal Inertia of Water:** Large water bodies act as conservative climate buffers due to high thermal capacity, vertical mixing (convection), and horizontal energy transport (**advection, $\Delta Q_A$**).

# 💭 Questions

- Which types of special characteristic of different land-cover are?
    **Albedo** (reflectivity), **Transparency** (volume vs. surface absorption), **Thermal Capacity** (ability to store heat), **Moisture Availability** (for latent heat), and **Aerodynamic Roughness** (how they "trip" the wind).
- What effects do those characteristics have on local climate?
	The land-cover effects vary the local climate by cooling the surface (with more water available in form of latent heat or having vegetation cover), changing net incoming radiation by having different albedo, and even the water equilibrium, since it increases or decreases the evapotranspiration and runoff depending on the system.
- How to identify the land-cover based on measurements?
    By considering the values of ground heat flux (can show if the lack of it could be by having vegetation or by volume heating as per beer laws), the latent heat (can show the amount of water or moisture) and the carbon measurements to determine the kind of vegetation.
- **How does the vertical location of the temperature maximum differ between a sandy desert and a snowpack during mid-day?**
    In a **desert**, the max temperature is at the **skin surface ($z=0$)** because sand is opaque. In **snow**, the max is **sub-surface (approx. 5-10 cm deep)**. This is because snow is translucent; sunlight penetrates the volume (Beer’s Law) and heats it from within, while the surface is cooled by the air.
- **Why is the longwave radiation emission ($L\uparrow$) almost constant over a deep lake compared to the extreme diurnal variation over bare soil?**
    Because the water is really good in storing heat, that means that the emission of it is not only during the day but during the night by that stored heat
- **Explain the role of the "Trade Wind Inversion" in decoupling the mixed layer from the free atmosphere over tropical oceans.**
    It acts as a **stable lid** (inversion) that prevents moisture from the ocean from mixing into the free atmosphere. It traps water vapor in the "Mixed Layer," allowing for shallow clouds but suppressing large storms.
- **In a forest canopy, why is the albedo typically lower than that of the individual leaves if measured from a satellite? (Hint: Radiation trapping).**
    Due to **Radiation Trapping**. Light reflects off one leaf only to hit another leaf deeper in the 3D structure. Each bounce allows for more absorption, lowering the total reflected energy (Albedo) compared to a flat, single leaf.
- **What happens to the partitioning of $Q^*$ in a vegetation stand during a severe drought period?**
    The latent heat decreases over time while the sensible heat increases. Plants close stomata, stopping transpiration ($Q_e$) and forcing energy into sensible heat ($Q_H$).
