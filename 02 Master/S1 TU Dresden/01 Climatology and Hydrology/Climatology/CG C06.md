Reminder from Abbreviations:

### Bare soil

The energy balance is idealized in this kind of site, so it was already studied

### Non-vegetated surfaces

#### Sandy desert:
Typically on the equator
No water
Typically high albedo

**Effects on energy balance**:

- High solar radiation input (80% of $S_0$)
- Still normal $Q^*$
	- Rather high albedo (0.2 - 0.45) $\rightarrow$ high $K\uparrow$
	- Surface heats up strongly $\rightarrow$ high $L\uparrow$
- No water $\rightarrow$ No $Q_e$ 
- Morning:
	- Surface starts heating up, $Q_G$ domimnates
- Afternoon
	- Strong atmospheric temperature gradient
	- Strongly unstable atmospheric boundary layer
	- Strong $Q_H$
- Energy transport in sand inefficient: no temperature change 30 cm below surface
- Extreme temperature differences at the surface 28 - 65
- Extreme atmospheric temperature gradients
	- Strongly convective
	- Can have high wind velocities

#### Snow and Ice:
Transparent to radiation
Multi-phase system
Typically high albedo, but variable

**Effects on energy balance**:
- Transparent to radiation -> radiation is absorbed in a volume, not at a thin surface layer?
	- Amount of incoming $K\downarrow$ reaching each depth is described by Beer's law
	- Snow: up to 1m
	- Ice: up to 10m
- Very high albedo (0.2 - 0.95) $\rightarrow$ very small $Q^*$
	- Most $K\downarrow$ is reflected
	- Albedo can vary too much
		- depends on age of sow and accumulation of dust
		- changes with solar angle, highest in the morning/evening

• Consideration of volume instead of layer: 
	• No QG at lower end of volume (no ground flux)
	• instead: change of energy stored in the volume (ΔQs)  needs to be considered 
• Multi-phase system: snow/ice → melting → water 
• Energy balance of a dry pack (all frozen): 
	• No QE 
• Energy balance of a wet pack (melting/freezing): 
• Energy consumed/released by melting of ice/freezing of water (ΔQM) needs to be considered 
**Water balance**: runoff Δr 

![[Pasted image 20251205094213.png]]
Example: melting snow pack • Morning: • Q* inceases, surface temperature increases • When temperature reaches 0 °C, melting starts,  ΔQM rises • QE rises as water is available 

Example: melting glacier • Dust on old surface reduces albedo → large net radiation • All energy provided by net radiation is consumed by melting • Water is transported away as runoff (Δr), not QE 


• Daytime:  Absorption of K↓ across a volum → very little increase of surface temperature during the day, stable to neutral  atmospheric boundary layer 

• Temperature maximum located beneath the surface 

• Nighttime: L↑ is released only at the surface of the snow • Snow has very low conductivity and diffusivity → insulating cover for the ground beneath → very little temperature change at the soil surface 


#### Water
Convection and advection below the surface 
Transparent to radiation 
Albedo changes with solar altitude 

**Effects on energy balance**:

• Absorption of K↓ according to Beer‘s law 
	• Penetration depth depends on wind speed and radiation absorbing substances/particles in the water 
	• Typically up to 10 m 
• Varying albedo: 
	• Radiation day (sunny): 
		• very high albedo in the morning and late afternoon (total reflection) 
		• Low albedo during the day 
		• Waves can modify dependence on solar altitude 
	• Overcast day: constant albedo, small 

• L↑ almost constant throughout the day 
	• Absorption of K↓ in a large volume 
	• Convection within the water body → very efficient transport of energy, energy is distributed over large volume 
• Small K↑ due to low albedo during the day 
• In the example on the right: 
	• diffuse radiation is shown: 25-30 % of the incoming solar radiation K↓ during daytime (clear sky day!) 

• Heat storage change within water volume ΔQS needs to be considered 
	• Positive during day (heat sink) 
	• Negative during the day (heat source) 
• Water currents can cause horizontal  advection ΔQA 
• High water availability → QE consumes 90 %  of Q* on an annual basis → low QH → low Bowen ratio (0.1)

**Effects on energy balance** - Shallow water:

K↓ reaches soil beneath the water and heats water body and underlying soil → Ground heat flux QG needs to be considered 

• Conservative climate in large water bodies: Little thermal response despite high absorption of K↓ Reasons: 
	• Penetration of short wave radiation (energy is spread over a large volume) 
	• Mixing (liquid → convection, very efficient) 
	• Evaporation (efficient latent heat sink) 
	• Large thermal capacity (3 times as much heat is required to reach a certain temperature increase in water compared to most soils) 

Atmospheric climate above tropical Ocean: 
• Near the surface: little variation with height 
• Mixed layer is capped by inversion 
	• Over oceans: trade winds develop 
		→ „trade wind inversion“ 
		→ formation of clouds but not precipitation (over oceans) 

### Vegetated surfaces

**New characteristics**:
• Energy and water storage in  vegetation (soil-plant-air volume) 
• Energy/carbon consumption/uptake by photosynthesis, energy/carbon release by respiration 
• Control of latent heat/water transport by systematically higher plants 
• Momentum sink within the canopy 

**Energy and water storage in soil-plant-air volume**:
• Storage changes within the soil-plant-air volume need to be considered: • ΔQS: change in physical heat storage in the volume  (same as in snow/ice/water) • ΔQP : change in biochemical energy storage due to  photosynthesis • ΔQA : change in storage due to advection • If the considered soil layer reaches a depth at which  temperature is constant throughout the day, no QG to deeper layersΔr • Runoff Δr and storage in air volume and on  plants ΔS need to be considered in the water balance

**Protosynthesis and respiration**

P = Daytime only, needs solar radiation (PAR)
R = Continuous 

NPP (Net primary production) = P - R


**Mass balances – carbon dioxide** 
• Diurnal and seasonal pattern • Growing season: • daytime: photosynthesis dominant  → carbon uptake → positive NPP • Nighttime: no photosynthesis, respiration dominant → carbon release  → negative NPP 

**Control of latent heat/water transport by systematically higher plants:**  • small openings in the leaf surface for gas exchange with air • Size and density depend on species • Can be closed to minimize water loss when • Light availability is insufficient for photosynthesis • Water loss is critical (water stress, drought) → Plant can actively influence ist climate! →Resistances of water vapour and CO2 exchange vary! →Drought: reduced carbon uptake and water loss 

**Momentum sink within the canopy**: Active surface concept: Instead of the surface of the soil, the active surface is considered,  which is lifted to the height of the “zero plane displacement height” $d$. → Stand architecture influences exchange of heat, mass and momentum!

• Rules of thumb to estimate $d$ and $z_0$ from canopy height ℎ: 
d \approx 2/3 h
z_0 \approz 1/10 h

d Zero plane displacement height (m)  
z0 Roughness length (m) 
ℎ Canopy height (10 % tallest vegetation) (m) 

• Effect on momentum exchange (and others) needs to be considered: 
u(z) - u(z_0) = u(z) = u_*/k ln(z - d / z_0)????

being z = variable of heigh


Radiation balance 
• Radiation primarly exchanged at the canopy surface (mostly leaves) → multi-layer system/volume • Considerable internal absorption,  reflection, transmission, emission • Radiation penetration of canopy described by Beer‘s law (see slide 11) • Depends strongly on stand architecture (height, density) 
• Albedo decreases with increasing stand height • Radiation trapping, mutual shadowing • Albedo depends on solar altitude • Highest albedo in the morning/late afternoon → time of low energy input → almost no effect on total  radiation budget
