## Surface energy and water balances

### Vegetated surfaces

Water balance
	• Transpiration: • Water released through stomata (see slide 28) • Interception storage: • Temporary water storage on plant surfaces (mostly leaves) • Stem flow: • Water running down the stem of the plants • Throughfall: • Water reaching the ground directly 

(New) characteristics: 
	• Energy and water storage in  vegetation (soil-plant-air volume) • Energy/carbon consumption/uptake by photosynthesis, energy/carbon release by respiration • Control of latent heat/water transport by systematically higher plants • Momentum sink within the canopy 
	• Energy and water storage in  vegetation (soil-plant-air volume) • Energy/carbon consumption/uptake by photosynthesis, energy/carbon release by respiration • Control of latent heat/water transport by systematically higher plants • Momentum sink within the canopy 
In vegetated surfaces -grassland and crops storage changes within canopy and air are very difficult to measure! • Ground heat flux is typically measured! 

Response of rc to changing soil water potential  >what is rc
• Soil moisture near wilting point • strongly reduced capacity of plants to extract water from soil • Water stress • High rc, reduced transpiration • Reduced cooling through transporation, high leaf temperatures →Conditions change with limited water supply →Vegetation can actively influence ET 

Effects on climate

• Profiles above canopy similar to bare soil (elevated active surface, zero plane  displacement height, slide 29!) • Within canopy: • Profiles are altered by momentum sink,  maximum of radiation absorption above the surface, shading at the surface, …) 

Above canopy
- Higher wind speed
- Higher temperature (and also in soil)
- Silimar or les vapour pressure
- Less carbon dioxiede

#### Vegetated surfaces - forest

Differences to crops

• Stand architecture: stem space and  crown space • Larger biomass • Higher canopy: • smaller albedo (radiation trapping) • Larger roughness length • Stomatal control different 

Effects on Energy balance: 

• Low albedo → low K↑ • Large leaf area → large ET → small surface temperature → low L↑ → high Q* (closer to K↓ than for other vegetation types) • Radiation balance above canopy!

Effects on climate

• Interception becomes a large factor in water balance! • Max inteception • Rain:  0.5 – 2 mm • Snow:  2 – 6 mm • Event intensity governs interception (60 % – 10 %)? 

• Daytime:  Temperature maximum is reached in the canopy, surface is cooler (shading) • Nighttime:  Temperature minimum is reached in the canopy, sinks down to the ground with a small delay Stratification inside forest is opposite to above the forest! 

Counter gradient fluxes
**Gust** (gust, sweep): transport air downwards 
**Buoyancy** (burst, ejection): outflowing air bodies (upwards)

1. The heat fluxes?
2. Interpret differences between three days -> mostrly clear sky days(?)
3. Interpret differences between energy and CO2 fluxes - 
4. Guess the land cover type and give two reasons -> negative CO2 indicate vegetation, Ground heat flux is quite large for the balance, a lot of radiation reaches the surface a hint it cannot be a super dense canopy, it can't be a forest
