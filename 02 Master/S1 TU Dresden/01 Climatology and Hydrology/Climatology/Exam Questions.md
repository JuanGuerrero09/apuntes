- Which law gives the wavelength at which a black body emit most energy
	+ Wien's displacement law
+ Which greenhouse gas absorbs the most terrestrial radiation?
	+ Water vapour
- An opaque surface has a reflectance of 0.4. How much of the incoming radiation is absorbed by the surface?
	- 60%
- Which layers can be distinguished within the atmospheric boundary layer?
	- Surface Layer, Atmospheric boundary layer,  Troposphere, Tropopause
- What would be the Earth's average surface temperature without the greenhouse gas effect.
	- Would be 255 k or -18 C
- At night ...
	- net radiation is ...
		- negative?
	- sensible heat flux is ...
		- negative?
	- ground heat flux is ...
		- negative?
- Which mode of transport is more effective? Convection / Conduction
	- Convection
- How are the water- and energy cycles connected?
	- Water balance at Earth’s surface:
		$P = L + G + R$
		
		where P: precipitation, L: evapotranspiration, G: infiltration/groundwater, R: runoff.
		
	- **Link between energy and water balance:**
		
		$\lambda E = L_v E$
		
		where LE: latent heat flux, E: evapotranspiration rate.

- Are the following statements true or false?
	- Net primary productivity includes litter respiration (F)
	- Soil conductivity depends on soil moisture (T)
- What is the difference between air temperature and potential temperature?
	- air temperature: actual measure of the air

	- The entire atmospheric boundary layer is turbulent. (F) (Little laminar part)
	- The boundary layer height changes throughout the day. (T)
- Name some characteristics of turbulence.
	- Irregular, dissipative, mixing, difussive
- Which number can tell you if a flow is turbulent?
	- Reynolds number
- Are the following statements true or false?
	- The boundary layer is limited by an inversion at the top. (T)
	- Vertical transport is enhanced under stable conditions. (F)
- Which one is constant within the surface layer?
