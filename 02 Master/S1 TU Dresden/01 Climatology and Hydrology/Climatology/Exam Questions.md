- How are the water- and energy cycles connected?
	- Water balance at Earth’s surface:

		$\lambda E = L_v E$
		
		where LE: latent heat flux, E: evapotranspiration rate.

- z/L < 0 indicates
	- Unstable stratification
- Free convection scales with
	- w*
- Turbulent energy is produced in the
	- macro range

1. The heat fluxes?
2. Interpret differences between three days -> mostrly clear sky days(?)
3. Interpret differences between energy and CO2 fluxes - 
4. Guess the land cover type and give two reasons -> negative CO2 indicate vegetation, Ground heat flux is quite large for the balance, a lot of radiation reaches the surface a hint it cannot be a super dense canopy, it can't be a forest
