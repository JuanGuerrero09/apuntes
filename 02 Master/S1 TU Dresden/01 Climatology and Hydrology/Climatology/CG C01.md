## Boundary-layer meteorology
_Boundary-layer meteorology_, sub discipline of _meteorology_ is about the state of and processes in the *air layer* in immediate contact with the Earth's surface.
![[Pasted image 20251017093845.png]]
This air layer, about 1 km in thickness and is the **interface** between the free atmosphere and the Earth’s surface.

The changes in the _bounday-layer_ state are controlled by processes that transfer *momentum*, *energy* and *materials* within the layers up and below. **Flux Variables** are used to quantify the rate of these *transfer processes*.

*Radiation energy exchange* is a key process that regulates the physical and chemical state of the boundary layer. Solar radiation supplies energy for evapotranspiration.

### Applications of B-L Meteorology

- Parameterization of surface fluxes in numerical weather prediction and climate models 
- Quantify & predict exchange of water and carbon 
	- Improved irrigation of croplands 
	- Carbon sink by land biomass 
- Understanding pathways of biological agents (pollen, spore, seeds) 
- Understanding dispersion of air pollutants 
	- Especially relevant in urban area

## Surface energy and mass balances

### Energy Balance
$$
Input -> System -> Output
$$
By the 1st Principle of Thermodynamics: Input – Output – Storage = 0

Forms of energy:
- Radiant
- Thermal
- Kinetic
- Potential
Transport of energy:
- Radiation
- Conduction
- Convection
Assumption:_ A system acts as process-response system: cause leads to effect_

## Radiation
Electromagnetic radiation, governing laws for a full radiator (= black body)
![[Pasted image 20251017095804.png]]

**Planck‘s law** describes the amount of radiation emitted at each wavelength

**Stefan-Boltzmann law** describes how much energy is emitted in relation to the black body‘s temperature:

**Wien‘s displacement law** gives wavelength at which maximal energy is emitted:

Radiation of sun and earth occur at a really different wavelengths

Gases and particles in the atmospher absorb and scatter radiation
- **Optical window?** in solar radiation wavelenghts
- **Greenhouse affect**: High absorption/scattering in terrestrial radiation
- Ozone absorbs UV radiation -> importance of Ozone layer 
- Largest contribution to greenhouse effect: __water vapor?__ 

### Radiation interaction with matter

Radiation can be spectrally _transmitted_, _reflected_ and _absorbed_.
$$
\begin{align}  
\psi_\lambda = \text{""psi"" transmissivity at wavelength }\lambda \\
\alpha_\lambda = \text{""psi"" transmissivity at wavelength }\lambda \\

\zeta_\lambda = \text{""psi"" transmissivity at wavelength }\lambda \\  
\end{align}
$$
**Kirchhoff's law**: : spectral absorptivity is identical to spectral emissivity 

- land surface (opaque) absorbs and reflects, but does not transmit 
- water bodies and the atmosphere absorbs, reflects and transmits

A lot of solar radiation is bvisibly light, 

Abedo: Reflecitivy of the solar radiation

Albedo -> Solar range, and emessivity -> terrestrial range

**Lambart's cosine law**: gives the flux density of the direct-beam radiation at the surface ($S$) based on the flux density normal to the direct beam ($S_i$) and the angle between the direct beam and the normal to the surface ($\theta$)
$$S = S_i cos\theta$$
A part of the incoming solar radiation is scattered by particles in the atmosphere (like clouds) or backscattered between surface and atmosphere
![[Pasted image 20251017101700.png]]
-> Reaches the surface as diffuse solar radiation ($R_{SW,in}$ Incoming solar (shortwave) radiation)

### Energy balance of the total earth-atmosphere system
 > Radiation is the only relevant transport form from/to outer space!
 
Solar constant: S_0 = 1367 +- 2 W m^-2 with a variation of 3% on an annual cycle
![[Pasted image 20251017101929.png]]
Globally averaged available energy is ¼: 𝑆𝑆0⁄4 = 342 W m−2
- The explication is because of the following The area of the disc of incoming radiation is \pi r^2 and the esphere is 4\pi r^2
![[Pasted image 20251017102059.png]]

Find the Earth's equilibrium temperature: the emitted terrestrial radiation equals the absorbed solar radiation

The albedo (𝛼𝛼) accounts for Earth‘s reflectivity. Earth‘s average albedo: 30 %  𝛼𝛼 = 0.3  The rest (70 %) is absorbed

Stefan-Boltzmann law describes how much energy is emmitted based on temperature (assuming Earth is black body, i.e., 𝜀𝜀0 = 1)

*GHG*: Greenhouse gas effect

![[Pasted image 20251017103008.png]]

Radiation of the sun is splitted in 3 *system boundaries*
	i. Top of Atmosphere (_TOA_)
	ii. Earth Surface (_ES_)
	iii. Atmosphere!
100% Comming in and comming out

Bein $A_C$ Atmospheric clouds and $A_a$ Atmosphere (molecules)

### Energy balance at an "ideal site"

Ideal site = Flat, horizontal, homogeneous and infinite.
![[Pasted image 20251017103938.png]]
### Common abbreviations
![[Pasted image 20251017103956.png]]

- Daytime: both sides positive
- Nighttime: both sides negative
$$R_{net} = G +H+LE$$
Net radiation during the daytime is positive, meaning that is coming towards the surface, while in the night is away from the surface is negative

Ideal site also means:
- Ideal site -> No advection (homogeneous)
- Ideal day -> No clouds
