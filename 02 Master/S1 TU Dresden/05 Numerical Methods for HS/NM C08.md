## Exercise 3

### Review spatial discretization

The system of algebraic equations:

$$
\underbrace{A_p \phi_p}_{\text{local change}} + \underbrace{\sum_lA_l \phi_l}_{\text{neightbour exchange}} = \underbrace{Q_p}_{\text{known values}}
$$

### Grid Convergence Study (GCS)
Order of convergence for the scalar flux $\psi$ on the top boundary of the domain.
$$
\psi = -D\int_0^L\frac{\partial \phi(x,L,t_{end})}{\partial y}dx\text{ , where, }t_{end} = 10
$$

## Turbulence modeling

Length scales of torbulent eddies

Large eddies → Generated by  the mean flow → Scale with flow  depth → Carry the gross  part of the  kinetic energy 

Microscale eddies → First described by  Kolmogorov (1941) → Viscous term  dissipates kinetic  energy → Relation to large  eddies 

Smallest scale in turbulent flows  → Kolmogorov length scale

Reynolds decopmposition

Turbulent flow: Reynolds shear stress

average over time to obtain Reynolds-Averaged NSE

-> closure problem: averagind introduces the new unknown quantity $\overline{u_i'u_j'}$ 

Turbulent viscosity dissipate the rest of the energy
$$
-\rho\overline{u_i'u_j'} = \mu_t(\frac{\partial \overline{u_i}}{\partial x_j})...
$$

The k-$\epsilon$ Model

Types of closure models for RANS simulations

k-e model

Shear stress transport (sst) model

k-w model

Reynolds stress model (RSM)


Large eddy simulation

Idea: • only more energetic large scale motions are resolved • small scale motions are modeled by a subgrid-scale  model 
Subgrid scale model to determine subgrid-scale eddy viscosity 휇푡 = 퐶푠2휌Δ2 푆መ → Smagorinsky model 


Different types of subgrid-scale models 

Smagorinsky Model  • 퐶푠 may not be a constant because it is dependent on the local flow  conditions • damping necessary to reduce eddy viscosity near walls • Does not account for anisotropy 

Dynamic Smagorinsky Model  • Filtered LES velocity field is filtered once more to determine 퐶푠 • May cause negative values of 퐶푠that cause instabilities 

Wall Adapting Local Eddy-viscosity (WALE) Model • Accounts for rotational rate and naturally goes to 0 at the wall • Well suited for complex geometries 

## Staggered grid and Finite Volumes

finite differnts works well until a certain reynolds number is reached? If we store everything in the center of the grid everythhing crash since you are not transporting the momentum just advection?

Staggered grids for velocity Note: grids for scalars and velocity do not commence →Staggered grid for u, v, w →temperature/pressure cell centered →better stability of the method e.g.  u_i+1/2−u_{i-1}−1/2 Δx  and  v_j+1/2−v_{j-1}−1/2 

With this is possible to day that the momentum is in and out

Finite volume method

Finite difference schemes are efficient to solve rectangular geometries with a regular grid  → useful for high performance computing 

Finite volume method for more complex shapes: Consider an arbitrary conservation law of the form: 휕풖 휕푡 + ∇ ⋅ 푓 풖 = 0 We can formulate that for  an 2D-elementary cell 푉푖 = Δ푥 ⋅ Δ푦 in an integral sense ׬푉푖 휕풖 휕푡 dV + ׬푉푖 ∇ ⋅ 푓 풖 푑푉 = 0 

Using the divergence theorem ׬푉 ∇ ⋅ 푭 = ׬푆 푭 ⋅ 풏푑푆, and the approximation of surface integrals:  ׬푆 푓 푑푆 = \sum_k \int_{s_k}f dS = S_n f + S_e f + S_s f + S_w f the original expression ׬푉푖 휕풖 휕푡 dV + ׬푉푖 ∇ ⋅ 푓 풖 푑푉 = 0 becomes ׬푉푖 휕풖 휕푡 dV + σ푘 ׬푆푘 푓 풖 ⋅ 풏 푑푆 = 0 

>explain better


Final volumes has better conservation properties

Summary • Working through exercise 3 will show you the combined effects of advection and  diffusion • Turbulence modeling is useful to solve for spatial scales that can otherwise not be  resolved • Every turbulence model gives rise to a turbulent eddy viscosity that enhances viscous dissipation • RANS is averaged in space and time, LES resolves the most important eddies in time • Staggered grids can stabilize numerical schemes for high Reynolds number flows and  this is useful for finite volume methods
