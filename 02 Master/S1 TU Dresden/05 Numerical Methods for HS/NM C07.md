Modelling turbulent flows

Scales scale in turbulent flows -> kolmogorov scale

edies? what is it

### Direct Numerical Simulation (DNS)

Summary 

• Governing equations of fluid mechanics:  (1) mass conservation, (2) momentum conservation, (3) advection-diffusion transport. • Navier-Stokes equation is a vectorial equation that has four unknowns • System can be integrated in time using the SIMPLE algorithm • Dominant mechanisms are characterized by dimensionless numbers • Most important mechanism: competition of inertia and viscous forces • Viscously dominated flows (i.e. 푅푒 small) are laminar • Inertia-dominated flows (i.e. 푅푒 large) are turbulent, i.e. swirling • Spatial discretization needs to reflect the smallest possible size of turbulent eddies 

## Part 5: Selected Scenarios

Solve NSE 

Laminar flow between two parallel plates
- Pressure driven Driven by pressure gradient (Poiseuille flow) e.g. in groundwater flow
- Driven by moving wall - e.g. in a lake

Vortical flows:
- Lid-driven cavity
Vorticity: how fast the fluid is spinning $\omega = \nabla \times u$
