# 📒Class Summary

- Examples of transport processes in the enviroment
- Processes described by ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
- Processes described by partial differential equations (PDEs)

• Transport processes are very important to describe quantitative movement of mass and matter in hydro science and environmental engineering 
• Transport processes are characterized by rates of change in space and time 
• Ordinary differential equations describe a change in time to characterize e.g. population growth and the motion of particles 
• Partial differential equations describes changes in space and time and they describe processes such as diffusion, wave propagation and convection

# 📝 Notes

## Transport processes in the enviroment
_Everything flows_
It's a multiphysics problem having all the above:
- Fluid dynamics
- Thermodynamics
- Solid mechanics
- Chemistry
- Biology
### Porous media flows
Water flows through porous medium when driven by *pressure gradient*.
#### Sediment transport
Movement of sediments in the enviroment, the modes are:
- Bed load transport
- Suspension
- Pyrocastic flow
- Mudslides and debris flow

### Derivatives
Rate of changes

### Differential equations
An equation that relates one or more unknown functions and thir derivatives
- Functions: physical quantities and dependen on a single variable

#### Ordinary differential equations (ODE's)

With the categories
- Homogenous
- Inhomogeonus
- Explicit
- Implicit
- Linear
- Nonlinear

#### Partial differential equations (PDE's)
Dependent on several variables, eg space (x, y, z) and time.
- Example: Darcy's law
Short hands to write PDES:
- Vectorial form
- Einstein Summation notation
Exapmles of PDE:
- Transport by advection/convection 

## Conservation of matter (2D)

Consider flux throught a control volume: $J \phi = \phi _u_ dA$ Jo = oudA


### Wave equation
Describes the propagation of waves in a medium
> Will be the first excercise


### Transport by diffusion - Flick's first law

### Transport by diffusion - Flick's second law

### Advection-Diffusion-Transport

### Types of PDE's

- Hyperbolic: Inforation propagate at finite speeds into two sets of directions
- Parabolic: Information propagates only into one direction
- Elliptic: no special direction of information propagatoin -> equilibrium

-> Important to choose how to solve the PDE numerically

#### Well-posed problem
The problem should follow:
- The problem has a solution
- The solution is unique
- The solution's behavior changes continuosly with the initial condition
