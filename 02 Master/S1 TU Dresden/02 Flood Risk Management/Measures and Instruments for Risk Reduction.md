## Measures and Instruments for Risk Reduction - First Part

Intervention in flood risk systems, what can we do

### Task and components of flood risk management

Risk analysis
- Hazard analysis
- Vulnerability analysis
- Risk detaermination
Risk evaluation
	Evaluation of risk
	Evaluation of risk reduction
Risk reduction
- Pre-flood reisk reduction
- Flood event risk reduction
- Post-flood reisk reduction

### Source-pathway-receptor.consequence concept

Source (rainfall, wind, waves)
->
	Pathway (overtopping, overflow, floodplain inundation)
	->
		Receptor (property, people, environment)
		-> (Negative) Consequence (loss of life)

The "reduction coefficients"

FR = f((p, m, t)_source, (i, a, f)_pathway, (s, r)_receptor, (v, c, d)_consequence)

p = probability, m = magnitude, t = retention
i = indundation, a = attributes, f = protection/defence
s = susceptibility, r = resistance resp. resilence
v = value or function, c = coping capacity, d = decrease or compensation


### Time of intervention

Pre flood design and implementation: long-term intervention e.g. increasing retetion, reducing vulnerability, etc

Flood event management: short-term intervention e.g. early warning, reservoir control, defence, evacuation, etc

Post-flood recovery and evaluation: short-term intervention. e.g. relief, cleaning, reconstruction, organizational and financial aid


### Form of intervention

- Pre event
	- Prevention: all activities to decrease the magnitude of floods or drought
	- Control: structures to reduce the magnitude of floods
	- Protection: Structural protection of existing vulnerable elements
	- Mitigation: reduction of vulnerable elements in flood-prone areas
	- Preparedness: Behavioural preparation for probable floods events
e.g. dams

- Event management
	- Defence: Management of a running event through dike defence and implementation of mobile elements
	- Warning: Forecasting of a running event and warning or emergy services and people at risk
	- Emergency response: Evacuation and rescue
e.g. Flood signs

- Post event
	- Recovery: Piblic relief, coverage by indusrances, reconstruction

### Measurements and instruments

Measure -> intervention causing impacts directly (e.g hydraulic structures)
Instrument -> Intervention triggering mechanisms which lead to impacts _indirectly_ (e. g. policy intervention)

but measures is not 'structural measures' and instruments is not 'non structural measures'

Discussion of instruments
...

### Classification

Measures
- Adaptation measures
- Control measurements
- Retreat measurements

Instruements
- Regulation instruments
- Stimulation instruments
- Compensation instruments
	- rISK AND LOSS DISTRIBUTION (EG. FLOOD INSURANCE OR PUBLIC RELIEF)
- Information instruments
	- Information / Dissemination: Transfer knowledge to and/or between 
	- Warning / instruction

### Adaptation measures

Land management

### Control Measures

Flood storage: Hydraulic structures in river channels, valleys, etc. e.g.

### Instruments

Instruments are considered that can be applied for frm systems at regional and local levels

Not considered on european level


#### Regulation

### Examples

Consrevation tillage
