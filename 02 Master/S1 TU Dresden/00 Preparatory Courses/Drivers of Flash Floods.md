## General causes for (flash) flood events

 Caused by _slow-moving thunderstorms_ or _thunderstorsm which move over the same area one right after another_. Short time period, **under 6 hours** or less.

Areas most susceptible to flash floodings are mountanious streams and rivers, urban areas, low lying area, storm drains and culverts

### Safety rules
- Don't drive through flood areas
- If car get's stuck leave the car inmidiatly

## Meteorological Drivers (Storms and Soil)

**Meteorological extreme event parameters**: amount, duration, spatial and temporal distribution.
Warm air has the potential of collecting more water
+
**Structural characteristics of the watershed:**
- Size of the watershed / catchment or river basin
- Topography / slope
- Retention characteristics (soil types, land use)
- River network
	-> Determine the prevailing hydrological processes runoff generation, concentration and flood routing
->
**Flood Event**
- Plain floods -> Slowly rising water levels, large areas
- Flash floods -> Rapid rising water levels, small areas

**Flood Hydrograph** Flood peak: [m3/s], Total amount of water, Duration


### Types of Thunderstorm
#### Single Cell
#### Multicell
#### Supercell
#### Mesoscale-Convective system

### Deep moist convection
Deep moist convection (DC) is associated with hazardous weather phenomena such as torrential rainfall and flash floods, severe convective wind gusts, large hail, and tornadoes. The latent heat release inside deep convective clouds plays a crucial role in several phenomena, for example, the intensification of hurricanes and cyclones in general.

## Hydrological Drivers (Catchments and Processes)

## Models and forecasting
Large river basins
- Forecasting start with the flood exceeding a critical water level in the relevant upsteam rever gauge
- Precondition is an unaltered riverbed
- Conceptional models -> forecasting is only relilable within the range of observed events

Small flood exposed river basins
- Depend mainly in rainfall information, wheat make it limited
- Improvement of forecasting preiod and reliability
	- Improvement of meteorological predictionsç
	- Implementation of rainfall runoff models
### State of the art of flood forecasting systems
Precipitation x Discharge based on Observation and Forecast

Precipitation radar -> DWD: Local precipitation model -> Precipitation forecast (P(t,[x, y])) -> Rainfall runoff model (Q (t,x)) -> Hydrodynamic flood routing model -> Forecast

FF Forecasting Systems

Flash Flood Guidance (FFG)
	Spatial Data - Threshold Runoff
	Rainfall, EVAPOTRANSPIRATION -> Soil Moisture model
		Flash Flood Guidance -> Forecast comparison -> FF Trheath

Early Flood Watning Scoring-Approach (ScoMH) -> Used ni saxony


### Flood forecasting systems
Unreliability of local precipitation forecasts
Numerical models involve much computational effort
	req: Replacing the commonly used models by adequate modern approaches (ANN)
	development ofa reliable hydrological/hydraulic model for the ocnsidered athcment as a preparatory step
