### Bonds and electrons

### Molecular Structure of Water

- Oxygen has **6 valence electrons**, needs **2 more** to complete the octet.
- The **O atom** forms two **covalent bonds** with hydrogen and keeps two **lone pairs**.
- The resulting **bond angle** is **104.5°**, forming a **bent molecule**.
- This geometry creates a **dipole** — a separation of partial charges (δ⁺ on H, δ⁻ on O).

The **104.5°** angle is the key to life. Because the molecule is "bent" rather than linear (like $CO_2$, which is $180^\circ$ and non-polar), the dipoles do not cancel out.

- **The Dipole Moment:** The oxygen atom "hogs" the electrons, becoming partially negative ($\delta^-$), while the hydrogens are partially positive ($\delta^+$).
- **Lone Pairs:** Oxygen has **two lone pairs** of electrons. These occupy space and "push" the H-O-H bonds downward, which is why the angle is 104.5° instead of a perfect tetrahedral 109.5°.



> “Similia similibus solvuntur” — _Like dissolves like_: polar solvents dissolve polar solutes.
Lone electrons pairs of oxygen?

### Hydrogen Bonds (H-Bonds)

- Result from electrostatic attraction between the **partial positive (H⁺)** and **partial negative (O⁻)** regions of different molecules.
- Responsible for many **unique properties** of water:
    - High boiling and melting points.
    - Surface tension and cohesion.
    - **Negative thermal expansion**: water expands when freezing.
    - Density maximum at **4 °C** (important for aquatic life).

Perfect tetrahedron: 109.5 degrees, water (liquid): 104.5

### Crystal Structure of Ice

- Forms a **tetrahedral lattice** with both **covalent** and **hydrogen bonds** (bond angle ≈ 109.5°).
- Creates open spaces → **ice is less dense than water**, allowing it to float.
- **Density Anomaly:** In liquid water, molecules are close but disorganized. As water cools toward **4 °C**, they pack tighter. Below 4 °C, H-bonds begin to force the molecules into a **rigid hexagonal lattice (Ice)**. This lattice contains a lot of "empty space," making ice ~9% less dense than liquid water.

### Stratification in Lakes

Due to density differences:

- **4 °C** water stays at the bottom (most dense).
- Ice and cold water remain on top, insulating deeper layers.
- This allows aquatic life to survive through winter.
- **Dimictic lakes** mix twice a year (spring & autumn).

---

###  Cluster Model of Liquid Water

- Water exists as small, transient **clusters** of 3–60 molecules, held together by dynamic hydrogen bonds.
- Explains water’s unusual combination of fluidity and structural coherence.*

Fun fact = The abnormal behaviour of water creates a protective shield for water animals. (Stagnation and Circulation in Stagnant Water Bodies)
![[Pasted image 20251013103815.png]]
Where there are seasons exist the stratification of the lakes (eutrophication). Always 4 degrees in the bottom

*Current problems*? -> Dimictic lakes are freshwater bodies that mix completely, or "turn over," twice a year in the spring and autumn due to temperature equalization.

# 🐢 Definitions

- **Electronegativity:** Tendency of an atom to attract shared electrons.
- **Dipole:** Separation of partial charges within a molecule.
- **Dispersion forces (London):** Weak attractions from temporary dipoles.
- **Enthalpy (H):** Total heat content at constant pressure.
- **Entropy (S):** Measure of disorder/randomness.
- **Vapor pressure:** Pressure of vapor in equilibrium with its liquid/solid.
- **Surface tension:** Tendency to minimize surface area due to cohesion.
- **Gibbs energy (G):** Criterion of spontaneity at constant T,P.
- **Speciation:** Distribution of an element among chemical forms (e.g., $\mathrm{NH_3/NH_4^+}$, $\mathrm{CO_2/HCO_3^-/CO_3^{2-}}$).
- **Buffer capacity:** Resistance of a solution to pH changes (in natural waters, dominated by the inorganic carbon system).
- **Alkalinity:** Capacity to neutralize acid (mainly $\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$, $\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}$, $\mathrm{OH^-}$).
- **Calco-carbonic equilibrium:** Equilibria of $\mathrm{Ca^{2+}}$ / $\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$ / $\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}$ with $\mathrm{CaCO_3(s)}$ (predicts scaling/dissolution).
- **Redox potential (Eh):** Tendency to gain/lose electrons (oxidizing vs reducing conditions).

### 💡 Questions

- Why does the **104.5°** bond angle make water **polar**?
	- Because it allows the geometric sum of the charges to generate a moment 
- Explain how **H-bonds** cause **density maximum at 4 °C**.
	- By the union of packs of molecules without that much empty spaces, at lower temperatures the ice has empty spaces and at higher temperatures the water molecules are dispersed in smaller chunks
- For the **ammonia system**, which species dominates at **high pH**: $\mathrm{NH_3}$ or $\mathrm{NH_4^+}$? Why?
	- idk
- Order the dominant inorganic carbon species at **pH 6**, **8.3**, **10** ($\mathrm{CO_2}$, $\mathrm{HCO_3^-}$, $\mathrm{CO_3^{2-}}$).
	- HCO, CO2 and CO3, based on the negativity (more H+ less pH)
- One method to estimate **alkalinity** and what it measures chemically.
	- idk
- How would you check if an ion analysis is **plausible** (mention neutrality and typical ranges)?
	- By accomplishing the matematic neutrality
- Distinguish **scaling** vs **corrosion** with one operational consequence each.
	- Scaling generates CaCo deposits that decrease the usable size of the pipes or tools, while the corrosion oxidates the material of the pipe or tool by damaging the material and eroding it
