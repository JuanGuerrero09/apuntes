# 📝 Notes


### Phase transition temperatures

Hydrogen bonds in the **cluster model of liquid water** form almost perfect **tetrahedrons**.  
In liquid water, there is a dynamic equilibrium between **clusters** (molecules connected by hydrogen bonds) and **free molecules**.  

Temperature affects this equilibrium — higher temperatures break hydrogen bonds, increasing the number of free molecules.

An increase in **pressure** breaks the tetrahedral structure, forcing molecules closer together and transforming ice into liquid water.

Electrons in smaller atoms are held more tightly to the nucleus. As atom size increases, outer electrons are farther away and held less tightly — this affects **polarity** and **bond strength**.

> Temporary dipole moments occur due to uneven electron distribution, creating weak **dispersion forces** between molecules.

#### Why is the boiling point of H₂O so high?

Hydrogen bonds are responsible.  
Elements like **F, O, and N** are highly **electronegative**, creating strong polar bonds. The stronger the polarity, the stronger the hydrogen bonding — increasing boiling and melting points.

**The Boiling Point "Anomaly":**

- **HF** has the strongest H-bonds, but **$H_2O$** has the higher boiling point.
- **Why? Water is "balanced." Each molecule has 2 hydrogens (donors) and 2 lone pairs (acceptors), allowing a 3D network of 4 bonds per molecule. HF has only 1 donor, and $NH_3$ has only 1 acceptor, limiting their networks.

- **HF** exhibits extremely strong hydrogen bonds, almost ionic in character.
- **H₂O** has an unusually high boiling point because each water molecule can form **four hydrogen bonds** (two donors, two acceptors).  
    To boil water, all these interactions must be broken.

### Water – Energetic Quantities

**Enthalpy (H)** is a measure of the total heat content or energy of a system at constant pressure.  
It represents the energy required to create the system and to make room for it by displacing its surroundings.

**Molar enthalpy** refers to the enthalpy change per mole of substance (analogous to using “a dozen” as a unit count in chemistry).

- **Molar enthalpy of fusion (melting):**  
    Amount of energy needed to convert 1 mol of solid water (ice) into liquid water at 0 °C.  
    → ΔH₍fusion₎ = 6.01 kJ/mol at 0 °C
    
- **Molar enthalpy of vaporization:**  
    Energy needed to vaporize 1 mol of liquid water into gas.  
    → ΔH₍vap₎ = 44.02 kJ/mol at 25 °C,  
    → ΔH₍vap₎ = 40.66 kJ/mol at 100 °C
    

**Molar heat capacity (Cₚ):**  
Energy required to raise the temperature of 1 mol of a substance by 1 K.

> Water has a very high heat capacity, making it an excellent **medium for heat storage** and temperature regulation.

### Surface tension
****Intramolecular interactions** pull water molecules inward, minimizing surface area and creating a “skin” effect.  
Liquids tend to assume shapes with the **least surface area per volume** — such as **spheres** — due to surface tension.

- **Cohesion:** Attraction among molecules of the same substance (e.g., water–water).
- **Adhesion:** Attraction between different substances (e.g., water–glass).

![[Pasted image 20251020101803.png]]

- **Surface tension $(\gamma)$ acts like a stretched rubber membrane. In a narrow tube (small $r$), the adhesion to the walls pulls the liquid up, while cohesion keeps the column together. The smaller the radius, the higher the water climbs.**

#### Vapor Pressure of Small Droplets

Small droplets have **higher vapor pressure** than large ones due to their **curvature** — smaller radius increases molecular escape tendency.  
This phenomenon is key for **cloud** and **fog formation**.

**Kelvin Equation:**
$$\ln\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right) = \frac{2 \gamma V_m}{rRT}$$
where:

- p: vapor pressure above a curved surface
- $p_0$​: vapor pressure above a flat surface
- $\gamma$: surface tension
- $V_m$​: molar volume of the liquid
- r: droplet radius
- R: gas constant
- T: temperature

### Gibbs Energy (G)

**Gibbs free energy** combines **enthalpy (H)** and **entropy (S)** to determine the spontaneity of a process.
$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

- If **ΔG < 0**, the process is **spontaneous**.
- If **ΔG > 0**, the process is **non-spontaneous**.
- If **ΔH > 0**, the process is **endothermic**.
- If **ΔH < 0**, it is **exothermic**.

**Entropy (S)** represents the degree of disorder or randomness in a system.  
**Solvation enthalpy** refers to the energy change when solute particles are surrounded by solvent molecules.

A **dissolution process** runs spontaneously when the total Gibbs energy change (**ΔG₍sol₎**) is negative.

# 🐢 Definitions

- **Electronegativity:** The tendency of an atom to attract shared electrons in a bond. High values (e.g., F, O, N) lead to strong polarity.
- **Dipole:** A molecule with partial positive and negative ends due to unequal electron sharing.
- **Dispersion forces (London forces):** Weak intermolecular attractions caused by temporary diples in atoms or molecules.
- **Enthalpy (H):** The total heat content of a system at constant pressure, representing internal energy plus the work needed to make space for it in its environment.
- **Entropy (S):** A measure of disorder or randomness in a system.
- **Vapor pressure:** The pressure exerted by a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid or solid phase.
- **Surface tension:** Force that minimizes the surface area of a liquid due to cohesive molecular forces.
- **Gibbs energy (G):** Thermodynamic potential that determines if a process occurs spontaneously under constant pressure and temperature.
- **Hydrogen-bond network:** Dynamic arrangement of hydrogen bonds in liquid water; explains high boiling point, heat capacity, and cohesion.
- **Kelvin equation terms:** $\gamma$ (surface tension), $r$ (droplet radius), $V_m$ (molar volume) — control curvature-induced vapor pressure.
- **Undersaturation / Oversaturation:** Vapor pressure below or above equilibrium value; governs evaporation and condensation.
- **Clausius–Clapeyron (concept):** Describes how saturation vapor pressure varies with temperature (slope of phase boundary).

### 💡 Questions

- Why is the **boiling point of water** much higher than expected from its molecular mass?
	- Because of the hydrogen bonds being strong and making bonds with up to 4 molecules, making it hard to break.
- Using the **Kelvin equation**, explain why **smaller droplets** evaporate faster than larger ones.
	- Because the radius is inversibely proportional to the pressure needed to evaporate
- How do **cohesion** and **adhesion** together explain **capillary rise**?
	- Cohesion is the preference of being in contact between diference surfaces, this make the contact between the liquid and a glass favorable and generate the capilary rise, while the adhesion favors the contact between the same sustance, avoiding the contact with the other surface, in this case, the glass going gainst the capillary rise
- Differentiate **enthalpy of fusion** vs **enthalpy of vaporization**; why is the latter much larger for water?
	- Is the work needed to generate change between state
- For a process with $\Delta H>0$ and $\Delta S>0$, when is $\Delta G=\Delta H - T\Delta S < 0$?
	- When the change in temperature is higher to the change in entalphy
- Provide two natural examples where **surface tension** is critical.
	- For the bugs that uses the surface tension to move above the water.
- How does **pressure** alter the ice structure and the melting behavior?
	- Higher pressure more temperature is needed to melt the ice
- Explain how water’s **high heat capacity** stabilizes **climate** and **aquatic environments**.
	- Since the water is able to storage a lot heat it allows the climate to cool by absorbing that as sensible heat, leaving less heat radiation for the air tempreature.
- Why do **dispersion forces** matter even in nonpolar liquids?
	- idk
