Water Chemistry (*Hydrochemistry*) is the science that studies occurrence, properties, and behavior of water constituents in natural systems and within the cycle of water use.

Water chemistry provides analytical methods to assess the water quality and scientific basis for understanding reactions.

## Hydrochemical Questions
- How much oxygen (nitrogen, carbon dioxide…) can be dissolved in water?
- Is a given water analysis plausible (feasible) or not?
- What pH value results from dissolving a given amount of an acid, a base, or a
salt?
- Does ammonium-N exist as NH3 or as NH4 at a given pH?
- How can I determine the concentrations of CO2, HCO3, and $CO_3^{2-}$ in water by means
of acid/base titration?
- What is the relevance of inorganic carbon species with respect to the buffer capacity of
water?
- What portion of the total hardness is responsible for scaling and how can we
determine this portion from analytical data?
- What pH is necessary to precipitate a given heavy metal as hydroxide?
- Is the water under consideration in the state of calco-carbonic equilibrium or is calcium
carbonate expected to be dissolved or to be precipitated?
- Is nitrate able to oxidize sulfide-S to sulfate?
- Under what conditions does iron exist as dissolved Fe2+ or as solid Fe(OH)3?

## 0. Introduction

### Intended learning outcome
- You can explain the meaning of scientific terms mentioned in the lecture (self-study: unknown terms/concepts).
- You can relate the chemical structure of water to its properties such as density and phase transition.
- Based on the afore mentioned you can relate physico-chemical
properties of water on its macroscopic behavior (e.g. in dimictic lakes, during transpiration, in hot packs…)
- You are able calculate the capillary rise of water as well as the change in vapor pressure for small water droplets.

### Bonds and electrons

Orbitals - Oxygen (6 electrons, 2 needed)
WHy is the 8 electrons balance needed?
Calculate electrons and probability in obrital

Lone electrons pairs of oxygen?

- 4sp^3 hybrids orbitar of oxygen
- 2 binding and 2 lone electron pais

Perfect tetrahedron: 109.5 degrees, water (liquid): 104.5

**Electronegativity** describe the affinity, high EN keeps the electrons close, low gets rid of it easily

Bond length: 96 pm
Bond angle: 104.5


The distribution of electrons generate **polarity** 
Deltas (image) are the actual charges of the molecule.

The position create the polar moment. "Similia similibus solvuntur" ("Like dissolves like")

*Hydrogen Bonds* result from interaction between the partial postivie and negatve charges, meaning, the polar moments. It defines the *structure* and *properties* of solid and liquid water. It also defines the boiling points.

**Crystal Structure of ice**
Has both bonds, _covalent_ and _hydrogen_ bonds with an angle of 109.5 deg.

Due **Hydrogen bonds** we have the *Negative thermal expansion*

Fun fact = The abnormal behaviour of water creates a protective shield for water animals. (Stagnation and Circulation in Stagnant Water Bodies)

Where there are seasons exist the stratification of the lakes (eutrophication). Always 4 degrees in the bottom

*Current problems*? -> Dimictic lakes

### FYI Stratification in Lakes

### Cluster Model of Liquid Water
