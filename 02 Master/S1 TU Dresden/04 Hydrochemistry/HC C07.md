## Acid/base reactions

### Learning Outcomes
1. You can explain the important role of acid/base equilibria in aquatic  systems and you can give 3 examples in natural waters.  
2. You can explain why the pH is referred to as master variable. 
3. You can define acids and bases according to the Brønsted´s theory. You can  explain the protolysis reaction.  
4. You can explain the autoprotolysis of water (chemical reaction). According  to this, you can describe the ion product of water. 
5. You know the 2 parameters which define the strength of an acid or a base  and you can divide them into 4 categories according to their strength. You  can explain the difference between a weak and a dilute acid or base. 
6. You know the relationship between Ka, Kb and Kw and we can calculate these  parameters. 

### pH Scale in aquatic systems

> Explanation

Acidic - 0 | Battery - Stomach Acid - Lemon - Vinegar - Tomato | 4
Neutral - 5 | Coffee - Milk - Water (7) - Blood - Baking Soda - Stomach Tablets | 10
Alkaline - 11 | Ammonia Solution - Soap - Bleach - Drain Cleaner | 14

$$
pH = -lg\,c(H+)
$$

#### Relevance of acid/base equilibria in aquatic systems

• water itself and numerous water constituents (WC) are acids or bases       according to the BRØNSTED´s acid/base theory,
• some gases act as acids or bases after dissolution (e. g. CO2, SO2,  NOx, NH3).   
• possible input soures for strong acids can be anthropogenic (industrial       processes) and natural (emssions of volcanoes and hot springs: SO2, HCl) 
• atmospheric depositions (acid rain): the strong acids (H2SO3, HNO3, HCl)     can disrupt the proton balance in numerous water and soil systems; fish toxic   ions (e. g. Al3+) can be released from minerals (alumosilicate) 

Due to its important role for the characterisation of aquatic conditions, the pH value is  referred to as **master variable**. Accordingly, the **pH value** represents a key variable  affecting chemical/physico-chemical/biological reactions in aquatic systems: 

•  complex formation  
•  redox reactions 
•  species distribution (e.g. NH3/NH4 +, CO2/HCO3 −/CO3 2−) 
•  solubility of many solids and gases depends on pH due to  coupled acid/base reactions 
•  growth and properties of (micro)organisms 

#### Brønsted-Lowry acid/base theory

$$
\underbrace{Acid}_{\text{proton donor}} \rightleftharpoons H^++\underbrace{Base}_{\text{proton acceptor}} \quad \text{conjugat acid/base pair}
$$
The ability to donate or to accept  protons determines if a substance acts as acid or base. Acids and bases are  not defined as “fixed” substance classes. They are defined according to their  function.  
e.g.
$$ \begin{gather}
H_2SO_4 \rightleftharpoons H^+ + HSO_4^-\\
NH_4^+ \rightleftharpoons H^+ + NH_3\\
HCO_3 \rightleftharpoons H^+ + CO_3^{2-}\\
\end{gather}
$$

#### Protolysis

##### Protolysis of acids and bases

- Proton release -> Deprotonation HA <-> A- + H+
- Proton acceptance -> Protonation B + H+ <-> BH+
- Protolysis?? HA + B <-> A- + BH+
Two conjugate acid/base pairs are always involved in a complete acid/base  reaction.
Protolysis reactions are reverse reactions where the equilibrium has  already reached within a short period of time.  

>Explain


##### Autoprotolysis of water
Water acts both as an acid and as a base. It is an **ampholyte**. In this case,  protolysis takes place between two identical molecules. Such a proton transfer  reaction is referred to as autoprotolysis. 

- Proton release - H2O <-> H+ + OH-
- Proton acceptance - H2O + H+ <-> H3O-
- Autoprotolysis?? H2O + H2O <-> OH- + H3O+ ??

Free hydrogen ions do not exist in aqueous systems. As H+ ions are formed, they are  initially hydrated by one water molecule to form the hydronium ion (H3O+). Then the hydronium ion is further hydrated: 

primary hydration sphere: 3 water molecules are bound by  hydrogen bridges H9O4 +   

outer hydration sphere: further water molecules can be  bound to the hydronium ion; the exact hydration number is  unknown 

$$
\text{Shorthand notation: } H^+
$$

$$
2H_2O \rightleftharpoons H_3O^+ + OH^-
$$
where:

$$
K^* = \frac{a(H_3O^+)a(OH^-)}{a^2(H_2O)} = \frac{c(H_3O^+)c(OH^-)}{c^2(H_2O)}
$$

since diluted solutions? (a = c, since $\gamma = 1$)

$$
\rho(H_2O) = 1000 g/L \rightarrow c(H_2O) = \frac{1000 g/L}{18g/mol}=55.56 mol/L \approx constant
$$

• solvent water is the main component in aqueous systems and exists in excess  compared to the dissolved components; the concentration of water can be seen  as _constant_  

• the constant water concentration is included in the equilibrium constant as a  constant factor 

##### Ion product of water

$$
K_w = c(H_3O^+)\, c(OH^-) \quad \text{or} \quad K_w = c(H^+)\, c(OH^-)
$$
Being $K_w = 10^{-14}\, mol^2/L^2 \text{at 25 ºC}$
