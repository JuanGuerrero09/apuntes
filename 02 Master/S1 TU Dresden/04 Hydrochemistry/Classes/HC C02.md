### Phase transition temperatures

Hydrogen bonds in the **cluster model of liquid water** form almost perfect **tetrahedrons**.  
In liquid water, there is a dynamic equilibrium between **clusters** (molecules connected by hydrogen bonds) and **free molecules**.  
Temperature affects this equilibrium — higher temperatures break hydrogen bonds, increasing the number of free molecules.

An increase in **pressure** breaks the tetrahedral structure, forcing molecules closer together and transforming ice into liquid water.

Electrons in smaller atoms are held more tightly to the nucleus. As atom size increases, outer electrons are farther away and held less tightly — this affects **polarity** and **bond strength**.

> Temporary dipole moments occur due to uneven electron distribution, creating weak **dispersion forces** between molecules.

#### Why is the boiling point of H₂O so high?

Hydrogen bonds are responsible.  
Elements like **F, O, and N** are highly **electronegative**, creating strong polar bonds. The stronger the polarity, the stronger the hydrogen bonding — increasing boiling and melting points.

- **HF** exhibits extremely strong hydrogen bonds, almost ionic in character.
- **H₂O** has an unusually high boiling point because each water molecule can form **four hydrogen bonds** (two donors, two acceptors).  
    To boil water, all these interactions must be broken.

### Water – Energetic Quantities

**Enthalpy (H)** is a measure of the total heat content or energy of a system at constant pressure.  
It represents the energy required to create the system and to make room for it by displacing its surroundings.

**Molar enthalpy** refers to the enthalpy change per mole of substance (analogous to using “a dozen” as a unit count in chemistry).

- **Molar enthalpy of fusion (melting):**  
    Amount of energy needed to convert 1 mol of solid water (ice) into liquid water at 0 °C.  
    → ΔH₍fusion₎ = 6.01 kJ/mol at 0 °C
    
- **Molar enthalpy of vaporization:**  
    Energy needed to vaporize 1 mol of liquid water into gas.  
    → ΔH₍vap₎ = 44.02 kJ/mol at 25 °C,  
    → ΔH₍vap₎ = 40.66 kJ/mol at 100 °C
    

**Molar heat capacity (Cₚ):**  
Energy required to raise the temperature of 1 mol of a substance by 1 K.

> Water has a very high heat capacity, making it an excellent **medium for heat storage** and temperature regulation.

### Surface tension
****Intramolecular interactions** pull water molecules inward, minimizing surface area and creating a “skin” effect.  
Liquids tend to assume shapes with the **least surface area per volume** — such as **spheres** — due to surface tension.

- **Cohesion:** Attraction among molecules of the same substance (e.g., water–water).
- **Adhesion:** Attraction between different substances (e.g., water–glass).

#### Vapor Pressure of Small Droplets

Small droplets have **higher vapor pressure** than large ones due to their **curvature** — smaller radius increases molecular escape tendency.  
This phenomenon is key for **cloud** and **fog formation**.

**Kelvin Equation:**
$$\ln\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right) = \frac{2 \gamma V_m}{rRT}$$
where:

- p: vapor pressure above a curved surface
- $p_0$​: vapor pressure above a flat surface
- $\gamma$: surface tension
- $V_m$​: molar volume of the liquid
- r: droplet radius
- R: gas constant
- T: temperature

### Gibbs Energy (G)

**Gibbs free energy** combines **enthalpy (H)** and **entropy (S)** to determine the spontaneity of a process.
$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

- If **ΔG < 0**, the process is **spontaneous**.
- If **ΔG > 0**, the process is **non-spontaneous**.
- If **ΔH > 0**, the process is **endothermic**.
- If **ΔH < 0**, it is **exothermic**.

**Entropy (S)** represents the degree of disorder or randomness in a system.  
**Solvation enthalpy** refers to the energy change when solute particles are surrounded by solvent molecules.

A **dissolution process** runs spontaneously when the total Gibbs energy change (**ΔG₍sol₎**) is negative.

# 🐢 Definitions

- **Electronegativity:** The tendency of an atom to attract shared electrons in a bond. High values (e.g., F, O, N) lead to strong polarity.
- **Dipole:** A molecule with partial positive and negative ends due to unequal electron sharing.
- **Dispersion forces (London forces):** Weak intermolecular attractions caused by temporary diples in atoms or molecules.
- **Enthalpy (H):** The total heat content of a system at constant pressure, representing internal energy plus the work needed to make space for it in its environment.
- **Entropy (S):** A measure of disorder or randomness in a system.
- **Vapor pressure:** The pressure exerted by a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid or solid phase.
- **Surface tension:** Force that minimizes the surface area of a liquid due to cohesive molecular forces.
- **Gibbs energy (G):** Thermodynamic potential that determines if a process occurs spontaneously under constant pressure and temperature.
- **Hydrogen-bond network:** Dynamic arrangement of hydrogen bonds in liquid water; explains high boiling point, heat capacity, and cohesion.
- **Kelvin equation terms:** $\gamma$ (surface tension), $r$ (droplet radius), $V_m$ (molar volume) — control curvature-induced vapor pressure.
- **Undersaturation / Oversaturation:** Vapor pressure below or above equilibrium value; governs evaporation and condensation.
- **Clausius–Clapeyron (concept):** Describes how saturation vapor pressure varies with temperature (slope of phase boundary).
