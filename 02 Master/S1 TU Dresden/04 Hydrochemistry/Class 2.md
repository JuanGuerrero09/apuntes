### Phase transition temperatures

Hydrogen bonds in the cluster model of liquid water form almost perfect thetrahidrums

In water you have kinda cluster formations. Temperature depinding equilibrium, Clusters vs Free molecules

Increase pressure brak the perfect orientation of the molecules and becomes liquid

Electrons are not as thight as the smaller size because those are closer to the nucleus

REVISAR TEMPORARY DIPOLE MOMENT (unequal dsitribution of electrons)

Why is the boiling point of H_2O is higher? -> Hydrogen bonds?

Electronegativity with F O N is so polar that increase the boiling points.

Never find F2 because of the electronegativity

Stronger the polarity difference stronger the hydrogen bonds. Almost ionic the HF?

Why water has it extra boiling point? 
Because the number of hydrogen bonds?

H and O can interact with other water molecule?. Because you need to rip all the hydrogen bonds

### Water - Energetic Quantities
Enthalpy: Kind of energy?
Molar: The dozen of the chemistry (next week)

Molar enthalpy of fusion (melting) -> How much energy is necessary from Solid to Liquid. For water 6.01 kj/mol at 0 c

From 0 to 80 degrees in the same liquid youll have the same 6 kj/mol

A lot of energy to break attractive forces in the ice cristal, same with evaporation

Molar enthalpy of vaporization: 44.02 at 25 deg and 40.66 at 100

Molar heat capacity, how much energy you need to add to increase 1 kelvin

> Water is an excellent medium for heat storage.

### Surface tension
**Intramolecular interactions** do a pull into the interior and a tendency to make the
surface as small as possible

Circular and shperes hasthe more volume in the least surface, therefore is preferred by surface-to-volume ratio

Cohesion Interaction among the same types of molecules

Adhesion: Interaction among different types of molecules

#### Vapor pressure of small droplets

Small droplets have a higher vapor pressure than large droplets (IMPORTANT FOR CLOUD AND FOG FORMATION)

Kelvin Equation:
>Insert eq

### Gibbs Energy (G)

Enthalpy (H) 

If change in H is positive is endothermig if is negative is exothermic

Entropy (S)

Reaction runs spontaneously if Delta G is negative

$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$
Dissolution process runs spontaneously if Detlta G sol is negative.


Solvation enthalpy

HYD#2526
## Intended Outome
ÔÇß You can explain the meaning of scientific terms mentioned in the
lecture (self-study: unknown terms/concepts).
ÔÇß You can relate the chemical structure of water to its properties
such as density and phase transition.
ÔÇß Based on the afore mentioned you can relate physico-chemical
properties of water on its macroscopic behavior (e.g. in dimictic
lakes, during transpiration, ‚Ä¶)
ÔÇß You are able calculate the capillary rise of water as well as the
change in vapor pressure for small water droplets.

Next week concentrations and ion balance
