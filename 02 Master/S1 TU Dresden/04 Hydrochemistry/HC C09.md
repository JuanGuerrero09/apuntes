## Reaction Equilibria in Aquatic Systems

### Acid/Base Equilibria

#### Degree of protolysis and pH
>what is protolysis?

Monoprotic acid -> $HA \rightleftharpoons H^+ + A^-$

The degree of protolysis $\alpha$ can be deducted from the $c(A-)/c_0(acid)$ to

$$
\alpha = \frac{1}{10^{(pKa-pH)}+1}
$$

# 💭 Questions

- How can the **concentration ratio** of a given **monoprotic** and **diprotic conjugate acid/base pair** be calculated at a defined $\text{pH}$? Explain the resulting relationship between the **degree of protolysis** and the solution's $\text{pH}$ for a monoprotic system.
- Describe the relevance and utility of **acid/base speciation diagrams**. Detail the primary features of the speciation diagrams for both the **ammonium/ammonia ($\text{NH}_4^+/\text{NH}_3$)** system and the **carbonic acid ($\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3$)** system, including the dominant species at different $\text{pH}$ levels.
- Explain the **important role** of the bicarbonate ion ($\text{HCO}_3^-$) in maintaining the $\text{pH}$ and buffering capacity of most **natural waters**.
- Define the terms **Acid Neutralizing Capacity ($\text{ANC}$)** and **Base Neutralizing Capacity ($\text{BNC}$)**. Which analytical method is typically used to determine these parameters in a water sample?
- Define the specific capacity parameters $\text{ANC}_{4.3}$, $\text{ANC}_{8.2}$, $\text{BNC}_{4.3}$, and $\text{BNC}_{8.2}$. Which of these parameters **plays no significant role in practice** and what is the chemical reason for its exclusion?
- Explain the relationship between the concentration of the **carbonic acid species ($\text{H}_2\text{CO}_3, \text{HCO}_3^-, \text{CO}_3^{2-}$)** and the Acid and Base Neutralizing Capacity parameters ($\text{ANC}_{4.3}$, $\text{ANC}_{8.2}$, etc.) for initial $\text{pH}$ ranges:
	- $\text{pH}_0 < 4.3$
	- $\text{pH}_0 = 4.3 \dots 8.2$
	- $\text{pH}_0 = 8.2 \dots 9.5$
	- $\text{pH}_0 > 9.5$
