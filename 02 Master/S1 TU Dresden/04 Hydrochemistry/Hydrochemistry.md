### Bonds and electrons

### Molecular Structure of Water

- Oxygen has **6 valence electrons**, needs **2 more** to complete the octet.
- The **O atom** forms two **covalent bonds** with hydrogen and keeps two **lone pairs**.
- The resulting **bond angle** is **104.5°**, forming a **bent molecule**.
- This geometry creates a **dipole** — a separation of partial charges (δ⁺ on H, δ⁻ on O).

> “Similia similibus solvuntur” — _Like dissolves like_: polar solvents dissolve polar solutes.
Lone electrons pairs of oxygen?

![[Pasted image 20251013102132.png]]
![[Pasted image 20251013102657.png]]
### Hydrogen Bonds (H-Bonds)

- Result from electrostatic attraction between the **partial positive (H⁺)** and **partial negative (O⁻)** regions of different molecules.
- Responsible for many **unique properties** of water:
    - High boiling and melting points.
    - Surface tension and cohesion.
    - **Negative thermal expansion**: water expands when freezing.
    - Density maximum at **4 °C** (important for aquatic life).

Perfect tetrahedron: 109.5 degrees, water (liquid): 104.5

![[Pasted image 20251013102930.png]]
**### Crystal Structure of Ice

- Forms a **tetrahedral lattice** with both **covalent** and **hydrogen bonds** (bond angle ≈ 109.5°).
- Creates open spaces → **ice is less dense than water**, allowing it to float.

---

### Stratification in Lakes

Due to density differences:

- **4 °C** water stays at the bottom (most dense).
- Ice and cold water remain on top, insulating deeper layers.
- This allows aquatic life to survive through winter.
- **Dimictic lakes** mix twice a year (spring & autumn).

---

###  Cluster Model of Liquid Water

- Water exists as small, transient **clusters** of 3–60 molecules, held together by dynamic hydrogen bonds.
- Explains water’s unusual combination of fluidity and structural coherence.*
![[Pasted image 20251013103654.png]]
Fun fact = The abnormal behaviour of water creates a protective shield for water animals. (Stagnation and Circulation in Stagnant Water Bodies)

### Phase transition temperatures

Hydrogen bonds in the **cluster model of liquid water** form almost perfect **tetrahedrons**.  
In liquid water, there is a dynamic equilibrium between **clusters** (molecules connected by hydrogen bonds) and **free molecules**.  
Temperature affects this equilibrium — higher temperatures break hydrogen bonds, increasing the number of free molecules.

![[Pasted image 20251020093923.png]]
An increase in **pressure** breaks the tetrahedral structure, forcing molecules closer together and transforming ice into liquid water.

Electrons in smaller atoms are held more tightly to the nucleus. As atom size increases, outer electrons are farther away and held less tightly — this affects **polarity** and **bond strength**.

> Temporary dipole moments occur due to uneven electron distribution, creating weak **dispersion forces** between molecules.

---

#### Why is the boiling point of H₂O so high?

Hydrogen bonds are responsible.  
Elements like **F, O, and N** are highly **electronegative**, creating strong polar bonds. The stronger the polarity, the stronger the hydrogen bonding — increasing boiling and melting points.

![[Pasted image 20251020095355.png]]

- **HF** exhibits extremely strong hydrogen bonds, almost ionic in character.
- **H₂O** has an unusually high boiling point because each water molecule can form **four hydrogen bonds** (two donors, two acceptors).  
    To boil water, all these interactions must be broken.
![[Pasted image 20251020095918.png]]

### Water – Energetic Quantities

**Enthalpy (H)** is a measure of the total heat content or energy of a system at constant pressure.  
It represents the energy required to create the system and to make room for it by displacing its surroundings.

**Molar enthalpy** refers to the enthalpy change per mole of substance (analogous to using “a dozen” as a unit count in chemistry).

- **Molar enthalpy of fusion (melting):**  
    Amount of energy needed to convert 1 mol of solid water (ice) into liquid water at 0 °C.  
    → ΔH₍fusion₎ = 6.01 kJ/mol at 0 °C
    
- **Molar enthalpy of vaporization:**  
    Energy needed to vaporize 1 mol of liquid water into gas.  
    → ΔH₍vap₎ = 44.02 kJ/mol at 25 °C,  
    → ΔH₍vap₎ = 40.66 kJ/mol at 100 °C
    

**Molar heat capacity (Cₚ):**  
Energy required to raise the temperature of 1 mol of a substance by 1 K.

> Water has a very high heat capacity, making it an excellent **medium for heat storage** and temperature regulation.

---
### Surface tension
****Intramolecular interactions** pull water molecules inward, minimizing surface area and creating a “skin” effect.  
Liquids tend to assume shapes with the **least surface area per volume** — such as **spheres** — due to surface tension.
![[Pasted image 20251020101343.png]]

- **Cohesion:** Attraction among molecules of the same substance (e.g., water–water).
- **Adhesion:** Attraction between different substances (e.g., water–glass).

![[Pasted image 20251020101803.png]]

---
#### Vapor Pressure of Small Droplets

Small droplets have **higher vapor pressure** than large ones due to their **curvature** — smaller radius increases molecular escape tendency.  
This phenomenon is key for **cloud** and **fog formation**.

**Kelvin Equation:**
$$\ln\left(\frac{p}{p_0}\right) = \frac{2 \gamma V_m}{rRT}$$
where:

- p: vapor pressure above a curved surface
- $p_0$​: vapor pressure above a flat surface
- $\gamma$: surface tension
- $V_m$​: molar volume of the liquid
- r: droplet radius
- R: gas constant
- T: temperature

---

### Gibbs Energy (G)

**Gibbs free energy** combines **enthalpy (H)** and **entropy (S)** to determine the spontaneity of a process.
$$
\Delta G = \Delta H - T \Delta S
$$

- If **ΔG < 0**, the process is **spontaneous**.
- If **ΔG > 0**, the process is **non-spontaneous**.
- If **ΔH > 0**, the process is **endothermic**.
- If **ΔH < 0**, it is **exothermic**.

**Entropy (S)** represents the degree of disorder or randomness in a system.  
**Solvation enthalpy** refers to the energy change when solute particles are surrounded by solvent molecules.

A **dissolution process** runs spontaneously when the total Gibbs energy change (**ΔG₍sol₎**) is negative.

## Properties of Aqueous Solutions

### Concentrations and Measures of Content

>**1 mol = 6.022 × 10²³ mol⁻¹** — Avogadro’s number, the bridge between microscopic (atoms/molecules) and macroscopic (grams/liters) worlds.

![[Pasted image 20251027083446.png]]
#### Solution

A **solution** consists of at least two components:

- **Solvent** – the major component
- **Solute** – the minor component dissolved in the solvent

---
### Mass Concentration (β)

Describes **how much solute mass** is contained in a given **volume of solution**.

$$
\beta(x) = \frac{m(x)}{V} \quad (g/L, mg/L)
$$
_Examples:_
- Coffee contains roughly 100 mg caffeine per 125 mL → $\beta = \frac{100\,mg}{0.125\,L} = 800\,mg/L = 0.8\,g/L$
---
### Molar Concentration (Molarity, c)

Represents **how many moles** of solute are present per liter (or volume) of solution.
$$
c(x) = \frac{n(x)}{V} \text{ or } \frac{\beta(x)}{M(x)} \quad \quad n(x) = \frac{m(x)}{M(x)} \quad (mol/L, mmol/L)
$$
- $n$: number of moles
- $M$: molar mass (from periodic table), mass per mole
- *m*: mass

_Avogadro-constant_ $(N_A)$ connects the *unified atomic mass unit* with g

$$1u =1.66 × 10^{-24}g, \quad 1u×N_A = 1g⋅mol^{-1}$$
**Definition:**  
A **mole** is the amount of substance containing $6.022×10^{23}$ entities (atoms, ions, or molecules).

_Example:_  
Caffeine → $M = 194.2\,g/mol$ (from periodic table):

$$
c(x) = \frac{n(x)}{V} = \frac{m(x)/M(x)}{m(x)/\beta(x)} = \frac{M(x)}{\beta(x)}
$$
$$c=\frac{0.8g/L​}{194.2g/mol}=4.12mmol/L$$

_number of entities_ $(N) = n*N_A$

---
#### Example: Water

Calculate molar concentration and number of entities for 100 g (1L) water, being $M$ = 18 $g/mol$ for $H_2O$.
$$\begin{gather}
n(\text H_2O) = \frac{1000g}{18 g/mol} = 55.56 \;mol \\
c(H_2O) = \frac{55.56}{1 L} = 55.56 \; mol/l \\
N = n*N_A = 55.56 \, mol * 6.022*10^{23} mol^{-1} =3.3*10^{25 } \text{ molecules}

\end{gather}
$$
---
### Equivalent Concentration ($c_{eq}$)

Equivalent concentration expresses concentration in terms of **chemical charge equivalents** instead of moles.
$$
c(\frac{1}{z}X) = \frac{n(\frac{1}{z}X)}{V}, \text{ or equivalently }\; c_{eq} = z\,c(x)
$$
Where:
- **c(x)** → molar concentration (mol/L).
- **z** → ionic charge (e.g., +1 for Na⁺, +2 for Ca²⁺, –1 for Cl⁻).

This allows comparing solutions based on their **electrical equivalence** rather than their molecular count.

The **condition of electrical neutrality** must always hold:
$$\sum_i c_iz_i=0$$
This means the total positive and negative charges in any solution must balance.
![[Pasted image 20251027095725.png]]

##### Plausibility Check

Because all water samples must be electrically neutral, we can verify a water analysis by comparing **cation** and **anion** equivalent concentrations:

$$
\sum \text{Cation equivalent conc.} = \sum \text{Anion equivalent conc.}
$$
>This ensures the measured ionic composition of water is **chemically feasible**.

---
### Molal Concentration (Molality)

Molality measures **moles of solute per kilogram of solvent**, not per liter of solution:
$$
c_m(x) = \frac{n(x)}{m(Lm)} \quad  \quad (mol/kg, mmol/kg)
$$
(LM = _Lösungsmittel_, German for solvent)

### Mass Fraction $w(x)$

Represents the **proportion of solute mass** relative to total solution mass:

$$
w(x) = \frac{m(x)}{\sum m}
$$
Dimensionless; when multiplied by 100%, gives **mass percent**.

_Examples:_
- 1 ppm (parts per million) = $1 g / 10^6g$ = 1 mg/kg
- 1 ppm (parts per billion) = $1 g / 10^9g$ = 1 $\micro$g/kg
- 1 ppm (parts per trillion) = $1 g / 10^{12}g$ = 1 ng/kg

---
#### Mole fraction $x(x)$

Similar to mass fraction, but based on **moles** of the solute in the solution instead of mass:

$$
w(x) = \frac{m(x)}{\sum m}
$$
Dimensionless; when multiplied by 100%, gives **mole percent**.

---
### Example
Mass concentration $\beta$ of nitrate $NO_3$ is 40 mg/L for a surface water. Calculate
- Mass fraction $w$ of N in nitrate
- Mass concentration of N as molar concentration (c) of nitrate and N
Given:
- Mass concentration β of $NO_3^- = 40\,mg/L$
- $M(NO_3) = 63\,g/mol$, $M(N) = 14\,g/mol$

1️⃣ **Mass fraction of N in $NO_3^-$​:**

$$
w(N)= \frac{14​}{63}=0.226=22.6\%
$$
→ 22% of nitrate’s mass is nitrogen.

2️⃣ **Mass concentration of N:**

$$β(N)=β(NO_3​)×w(N)=40mg/L×0.226=9.04mg/L$$
→ The sample contains 9.04 mg of nitrogen per liter.


3️⃣ **Convert to molar concentration:**

$$
\begin{gather}
C = \frac{\beta}{M} = \frac{0.04 \text{g/L}}{62 \text{g/mol}} = 0.00064 mol/L \text{ or } = 0.645 mmol/L \\
C = \frac{\beta}{M} = \frac{9.04 \text{mg/L}}{14 \text{mg/mmol}} = 0.645 mmol/L
\end{gather}
$$
---
### Dalton’s Law of Partial Pressures

> _The total pressure of a gas mixture equals the sum of the partial pressures of each component gas._

For example, atmospheric pressure (1 bar) contains mainly nitrogen and oxygen:

- $N_2= 78\% \Rightarrow 0.78\,bar$
- $O_2 = 20\% \Rightarrow 0.20\,bar$

$$1\,atm = 101325\,Pa, \quad 1\,Pa = 1\,N/m^2$$
## Hardness of Water

- **Total Hardness (TH):** sum of $Ca^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$ concentrations.
- **Carbonate Hardness (CH):** part of hardness due to $HCO_3^-$​ and $CO_3^{2-}$​.
- **Non-Carbonate Hardness (NCH):** remainder due to other anions (e.g., $SO_4^{2-}​, Cl^-$).


$$
TH = CH+NCH
$$

Only $Ca^{2+}$ and $Mg^{2+}$  determine hardness.

---

When **CH < TH**, both carbonate and non-carbonate hardness are present.  
When **CH = TH**, only carbonate hardness exists (no non-carbonate part).  
CH can **never exceed** TH.

![[Pasted image 20251027103330.png]]
At high temperatures, **temporary (carbonate) hardness** causes precipitation of calcium carbonate — the main reason for **scaling in pipes and boilers**.

### Why is carbonate hardness _temporary_?

Carbonate hardness is mainly caused by **calcium bicarbonate** ($Ca(HCO_3)_2$) and **magnesium bicarbonate** ($Mg(HCO_3)_2$), which are **soluble salts**.  
When water containing these ions is **heated**, the bicarbonates **decompose**, releasing **carbon dioxide (CO₂)** and forming **insoluble carbonates** that precipitate:

$$Ca(HCO_3)_2 \rightarrow CaCO_3 \downarrow + CO_2 \uparrow + H_2O$$

This means that when water is boiled or evaporated, part of the dissolved calcium and magnesium are removed from solution as **solid calcium carbonate (CaCO₃)** or **magnesium carbonate (MgCO₃)**.  
Because this hardness can be **removed by heating**, it is called **temporary hardness**.

In contrast, **non-carbonate hardness** (from ions like $SO_4^{2-}$​ or $Cl^-$) remains even after boiling — it is **permanent hardness**.

This process explains the formation of **scale in kettles, boilers, and pipes**, where calcium carbonate accumulates as a solid layer.

---
How to calculate it from the $HCO^{-}_3$?
$$
c(Ca^{2+}+Mg^{2+})_{CH}=\frac{1}{2}c(HCO^{-}_3) 
$$
This relationship arises from **charge balance** in the bicarbonate system.

Each **calcium ion** (Ca^{2+}) or **magnesium ion** (Mg2+Mg^{2+}Mg2+) carries **two positive charges**, while each **bicarbonate ion** (HCO3−HCO_3^-HCO3−​) carries **one negative charge**.  
Therefore, to maintain electrical neutrality, **two bicarbonate ions** are required for every **one divalent cation**:

$$Ca^{2+} + 2HCO_3^- \rightarrow Ca(HCO_3)_2$$

Hence, the **concentration of divalent cations (Ca²⁺ + Mg²⁺)** associated with carbonate hardness is **half** the concentration of bicarbonate ions:

$$c(Ca^{2+}+Mg^{2+})_{CH} = \frac{1}{2}c(HCO_3^-)$$

This proportionality reflects the **stoichiometry** of the ions in solution and ensures **charge neutrality** between cations and anions in the carbonate equilibrium system.

---

### Worked example (cleaned and explained)

**Given (one water sample):**

- $c(Ca^{2+}) = 1.8\ \text{mmol/L}$
- $c(Mg^{2+}) = 0.4\ \text{mmol/L}$
- $c(HCO_3^-)=2.6\ \text{mmol/L}$

**Step 1 — Total hardness (TH):**  
Total hardness is the sum of the alkaline-earth cation concentrations (as mmol/L here):

$$TH=c(Ca^{2+})+c(Mg^{2+})=1.8+0.4=2.2 mmol/L$$

**Step 2 — Carbonate hardness (CH):**  
Carbonate hardness is the portion of Ca²⁺ and Mg²⁺ that is paired with bicarbonate/carbonate. Stoichiometry requires 2 bicarbonate ions per one divalent cation, so the carbonate-associated cation concentration is half the bicarbonate concentration:

$$CH = \tfrac{1}{2}\,c(HCO_3^-) = \tfrac{1}{2}\times 2.6 = 1.3\ \text{mmol/L}$$

Interpretation: up to 1.3 mmol/L of the Ca²⁺+Mg²⁺ present can be associated with bicarbonate (i.e., “temporary” hardness).

**Step 3 — Non-carbonate hardness (NCH):**  
Non-carbonate hardness is the remainder of TH not accounted for by CH:

$$NCH = TH - CH = 2.2 - 1.3 = 0.9\ \text{mmol/L}$$

Interpretation: 0.9 mmol/L of the Ca²⁺+Mg²⁺ are associated with other anions (e.g., SO₄²⁻, Cl⁻) — this is **permanent hardness** (won’t precipitate by simple heating)- .

---
### What happens if we have **high hardness**? (practical consequences & remedies)

**Phenomena / problems:**

- **Scaling / fouling** in boilers, kettles, heat exchangers, and pipes (CaCO₃ deposits reduce efficiency).
- **Poor soap performance:** hard water reacts with soaps to form insoluble “soap scum,” reducing cleaning efficiency.
- **Plumbing & appliance damage:** scale narrows pipes and shortens appliance lifetime.
- **Increased energy consumption:** scale lowers heat transfer efficiency.
- **Aesthetic/operational issues:** spots on dishes, dull laundry, taste changes.
- **Possible effects on corrosion:** hard water can be less corrosive in some systems (protective scale), but scale formation can cause under-deposit corrosion in others.

**How to mitigate high hardness:**

- **Ion exchange (water softening):** replace Ca²⁺/Mg²⁺ with Na⁺ (common domestic softeners).
- **Lime softening:** add Ca(OH)₂ to precipitate CaCO₃ and Mg(OH)₂ in water treatment.
- **Reverse osmosis / nanofiltration:** remove hardness ions physically.
- **Sequestration / chelants (polyphosphates):** keep hardness ions in solution to prevent precipitation (temporary measure, not removal).
- **pH control / CO₂ management:** in industrial systems, control pH/CO₂ to minimize scale formation.
- **Descaling maintenance:** chemical or mechanical removal of accumulated scale.
