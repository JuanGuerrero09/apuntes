Absolutely — here’s the **cleaned-up, English version**, with a deeper breakdown for **priority tiers and common users**, as requested.

---

## 📊 **IVs & EVs in VGC (Level 50)**

- Battles are always at **Lv. 50**.
    
- IVs (0–31) are “natural” stats.
    
- EVs (0–252 per stat, 510 total) are _trainable_.
    

Competitive players **don’t just dump 252/252/4** — they **optimize spreads** to:

- Survive _one or two key meta attacks_.
    
- Outspeed _specific threats_ by 1 point.
    
- Hit certain **bulk/speed benchmarks**.
    

---

## 🥚 **Breeding**

Originally required for perfect IV Pokémon.  
Nowadays, **Bottle Caps + Mints + Ability Patches** replace breeding _for competitive stats_, but breeding is still used for **egg moves** like _Follow Me_, _Helping Hand_, or _Fake Out_.

---

## ⚡ **Speed & Speed Control**

Speed determines _move order_ — in doubles that’s often the difference between winning and losing.

**Speed Control tools:**

- **Tailwind** (doubles Speed 4 turns)
    
- **Icy Wind / Electroweb** (drops opponent Speed)
    
- **Paralysis** (1/4 Speed + chance to not move)
    
- **Trick Room** → slow becomes fast
    

_Modern VGC is a fight between Tailwind offense vs Trick Room cores._

## 🔥🌊🍃 **Cores & Coverage**

Building _Fire–Water–Grass_ or _Fairy–Steel–Dragon_ offensive and defensive cores ensures your team covers the majority of typings and threats both offensively and switch-wise.

## ⚔️ **Priority & Prankster**

Priority moves act **before normal-speed moves**, based on tier:

|Priority Tier|Example Move|Users|
|---|---|---|
|**+3**|Follow Me|Indeedee-F, Togekiss|
|**+2**|Rage Powder|Amoonguss, Volcarona|

|**+0**|Most moves|–|
|**–n**|Trick Room (–6)|Porygon2, Hatterene, Farigiraf|

**Prankster** → gives _non-damaging_ moves **+1 priority**  
(Common users: **Whimsicott, Grimmsnarl, Murkrow**)

**Armor Tail (Farigiraf)** → blocks **priority moves aimed at its side**, shutting down Fake Out, Sucker Punch, Prankster utility, etc.
