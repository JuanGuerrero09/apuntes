# General Tips for Going to Regionals

## Preparation
- **Practice with your tournament team**  
  Practice as much as possible with the team you plan to bring. There are diminishing returns after a certain point, but try to have a game plan for at least the **top 5 teams** you expect to face.  
  Personally, I prefer *Showdown* Bo3 and logging my games to the **PASRS** sheet to track records and leads in practice, but everyone has their own preferred way â€” yours may differ.

- **Double/triple check your team sheet**  
  When creating the teamsheet on **RK9**, double or triple check everything. Registering the wrong moves or Tera Types will result in a game loss if they donâ€™t match.

## Before the Tournament
- **Badge pickup**  
  If badge pickup is available on Friday, take advantage of it. Otherwise, you will have to pick up your badge/wristband on Saturday before entering the hall.

- **Rest well**  
  Get a good nightâ€™s sleep before the tournament. Round 1 usually starts before 9 AM. Factor in travel time from your hotel/Airbnb to the venue unless youâ€™re staying right next to it.

- **Restroom queues**  
  Expect a line at the menâ€™s restroom before Round 1. If you need to go, donâ€™t wait until 1 minute before pairings are posted.

- **Get fresh air between rounds**  
  The halls can be hot and sweaty; stepping outside for clear air will help.

## What to Bring
- **Required**:  
  - Your **Switch** with the game and the team youâ€™re playing.

- **Strongly recommended**:  
  - **Wired controller** (Pro Controller works if set to *Only Wired Mode*). Wireless controllers are not allowed. Avoid using Joy-Cons for long periods; theyâ€™ll hurt your back.  
  - **Working pen** and **notepad** for taking notes during games.  
  - **Wired headphones** (preferably noise-canceling or sound-blocking) that are comfortable for long use.  
  - **Refillable water bottle** â€” cheaper than buying drinks between rounds.  
  - **Small snack** like protein bars or bananas â€” venue food is usually overpriced.  
  - **Phone** with enough battery to last the day (bring a power bank if needed) and an active data plan to check pairings on **RK9**.  
    - If traveling from abroad, consider buying an eSIM (e.g., through Airalo) for the tournament country.
