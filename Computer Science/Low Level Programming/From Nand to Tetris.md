Nothing is more important than seeing the sources of invention which are, in my opinion, more interesting than the inventions themselves. –Leibnitz (1646-1716)
The elementary logic gate Nand (or its close relative Nor) is the fundamental building block
from which all hardware platforms are made. In this course we start from the humble Nand
gate and work our way through the construction of a modern computer system – hardware and software – capable of running Tetris and any other program. In the process, we will learn how computers work, how they are constructed, and how to plan and execute large-
scale systems building projects.

Prerequisite: The course is open to undergraduate and graduate students from all schools,
the only prerequisite being an Introduction to CS (Computer Science) or equivalent. This is
a self-contained course: All the CS knowledge and tools needed for building the computer
and completing the course are given in the course itself.
Overview: Nand to Tetris is a journey of discovery, synthesizing key topics in applied CS
in one unified framework. This is done constructively, by building a general-purpose
computer system from the ground up. We’ll explore key ideas and techniques used in the
design of modern hardware and software systems, and discuss major trade-offs and future
trends. As we go through this journey, you will gain many cross-section views of the
computing field, from the details of bare bone switching circuits to the compilation of high-
level software abstractions. We will also provide a historical perspective, narrating the key

people, circumstances and innovations that paved the way to the digital computer.
At which stage in the program it is best to take this course? If you've already taken some
CS courses, Nand to Tetris will help integrate them into a coherent picture, showing the
forest for the trees. If you've just taken introduction to CS, Nand to Tetris will provide an
organizing roadmap that will accommodate subsequent courses in applied CS.
Methodology: This is mostly a hands-on journey. Each hardware and software module of
the emerging computer will be introduced by an abstract specification and an executable
solution, illustrating what the module is designed to do. This will set the stage for a detailed
implementation guideline, proposing how to build the module, and a test script, specifying
how to test its evolving implementation.
Programming: The hardware modules will be built using a simple Hardware Description
Language, learned in the course. You will simulate and test your HDL-based chips on a
supplied hardware simulator running on your PC – exactly how chips are designed in
industry. The software projects (an assembler, a virtual machine, and a compiler) can be
done in Java, Python, Perl, or other languages approved by your instructor.
Testing: The hardware and software modules built in the course can be tested in three ways.
First, you will test them on your PC, using supplied tools and test scripts. Second, you’ll be
able to upload them to a server that tests correctness and provides useful feedback. Finally,
the course staff will review your work, focusing on readability, elegance, and efficiency.
Course Grade: 60% projects grades and 40% final examination.
Textbook: Nisan and Schocken, The Elements of Computing Systems, MIT Press
(recommended, not required).

Course Plan (by week)
Part I: Hardware
We’ll build a general-purpose computer equipped with a symbolic machine language
and an assembler. To give motivation and context, we’ll start the journey by
demonstrating some of the numerous video games that were already developed for
this computer: Pong, Snake, Space Invaders, Life, Google’s Dyno, and more.
1. Boolean logic: We will start with basic concepts in gate logic and Boolean algebra, and
discuss the importance of separating abstraction from implementation. We’ll provide a
theoretical proof that any computer can be built from Nand gates only, and present a
simple Hardware Description Language that allows doing it in practice. In project 1 you
will use this HDL to build a set of elementary logic gates (And, Or, Not, Mux, ...) from
primitive Nand gates.
1. Boolean arithmetic: We’ll learn how to use bits (0’s and 1’s) for representing signed
numbers, and how to use logic gates for realizing arithmetic operations on such bitwise
representations. We will then show how elementary logic gates can be used to build a
family of adder chips, culminating in the construction of an Arithmetic-Logic Unit. In
project 2 you will build this ALU, using the logic gates built in project 1.
1. Memory: We’ll explain how sequential logic, clocks, and elementary time-dependent
gates called flip-flops can be used to maintain state and realize memory units. We’ll also
discuss the crucial invention of the transistor. In project 3 you will build a memory
hierarchy, from single-bit cells to registers to RAM units of arbitrary sizes.
1. Machine language: This is the delicate software-hardware interface where high-level
programs are ultimately reduced to concrete binary codes committed to silicon. We’ll
introduce an instruction set and an abstract computer architecture, and learn how to
write low-level programs in this framework. We’ll also learn how to handle input /
output devices (a screen and a keyboard) using memory-resident bitmaps. In project 4
you will write some low-level interactive programs in assembly language and execute
them on a supplied CPU emulator, running on your PC.
1. Computer architecture: We’ll describe the stored program concept, the fetch-execute
cycle, a general computing framework that informs the design of all computer
architectures, and the microchip revolution. We will then show how the chips built in
weeks 1-3 can be integrated into a computer platform capable of running programs
written in the instruction set introduced in week 4. In project 5 you will build this
computer, known as Hack, and use it to run the programs you wrote in project 4.
1. Assembler: In 1843, Ada Lovelace showed how symbolic instructions can liberate
programming from the obscure tyranny of binary codes. We will learn how to translate
the symbolic instructions introduced in week 4 into the binary micro-codes understood
by the computer built in week 5. In order to develop this translator, known as
assembler, we will learn how to perform parsing, code generation, and symbol
resolution. This will set the stage for project 6, in which you will build this assembler,
using a high-level language of your choice.
Part II: Software
Using the computer built in Part I as a point of departure, we will build a multi-tier
software hierarchy consisting of a virtual machine, a compiler for a simple java-like
programming language, and a basic operating system. Acting as the systems
architects, we’ll provide elaborate implementation guidelines, scaffolding, and APIs.
1. Virtual machine I: Modern compilers typically translate high-level programs into an
intermediate code designed to run on an abstract virtual machine. Following a
discussion of pushdown automata and stack processing, we’ll discuss the role of virtual
machines in software architectures like Java, Python, and .NET. We will then present a
simple VM language, modeled after Java’s JVM. In project 7 you will write a JRE-like
program that translates the push/pop and arithmetic VM commands into assembly code,
designed to run on the Hack computer built in part I of the course.
1. Virtual machine II: We’ll discuss two critically important programming abstractions –
branching and subroutines – and show how they can be realized on our virtual machine.
In particular, we’ll discuss algorithms for realizing goto and function-call-and-return
commands on a global stack. In project 8 you will extend the basic translator built in
project 7 into a full-blown VM translator. This translator will become the backend of
compilers that translate high-level programs into VM code (similar to Bytecode).

1. High Level Language: We’ll introduce Jack – a simple, high-level, object-based, java-
like language. We’ll discuss language design issues and trade-offs, and how Jack can be

realized over the Hack platform. In project 9 you will select a computer game idea, and
implement it in Jack. It will be thrilling to see this game running on the computer that
you’ve built in Part I of the course. You will develop this program using executable
versions of the compiler and OS that we now turn to describe.
1. Compiler I: We’ll discuss context-free grammars and recursive parsing algorithms, and
guide how they can be used for building a syntax analyzer (tokenizer and parser) for the
Jack language presented in week 9. In project 10 you will implement this analyzer,
using a proposed software architecture and API.
1. Compiler II: We’ll discuss how to realize high-level programming abstractions
(classes, methods, statements, expressions, objects, etc.) by generating VM code for the
virtual machine built in weeks 7-8. In project 11 you will morph the syntax analyzer
built in week 10 into a full-scale compiler that translates Jack programs into VM code.
1. Operating system: The OS is designed to close gaps between Jack and Hack. We’ll
discuss classical OS algorithms for managing memory, realizing mathematical
operations, rendering graphics, handling strings, and more – and a bootstrapping
technique for realizing these services efficiently on the Hack platform. In project 12 you
will implement this OS in Jack, in the spirit of how Unix was implemented in C.
1. More fun to go: We’ll discuss ideas for extending and optimizing the hardware and
software systems built in the course. For example, how to implement a file system and
an OS shell, and how to connect the Hack computer to the Internet. We’ll also describe
how to build the computer in silicon, using FPGA. These are some of our design itches;
