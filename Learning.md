ML Engineering

develop ML approaches such as diffusion, pixelwise regression, sensor fusion and GNNs to create DEMs, regionalise our data, predict riverflow and downscale climate data.

**Implement and develop machine learning models** from research papers

computer vision for DEMs, diffusion models for climate downscaling, and neural networks for hydrological predictions.

**Work with spatial data:** Utilize and process various geospatial data types, contributing to our advanced spatial analytics.

maintenance and deployment of ML models

**Python** and relevant ML libraries (e.g., PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn).

Experience or a keen interest in working with **spatial data types** and geospatial libraries (e.g. geopandas, xarray).

 large-scale datasets and distributed computing.

hydrological processes or climate science.
